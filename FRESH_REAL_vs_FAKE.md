# A/B TEST: FRESH AUTHENTIC OMAR vs AI-GENERATED "OMAR"

## INSTRUCTIONS:
Each pair shows authentic writing from different time periods vs AI rewritten to sound like you. Can you tell which is real?

### PAIR 1: Casual sports debate (2006)

**Version A**:
how can you watch a game for a sport you dont care about when you already know the score? i can barely watch a basketball/football/baseball game if i know how it ends. this is getting too complicated.

**Version B**:
Honestly, I don't get how you can watch a sports game when you already know what happens. Like, if I already know the final score of a basketball or football game, I can barely get through it. This whole situation is getting way too complicated if you ask me.

### PAIR 2: Apartment hunting (2011)

**Version A**:
I saw a few other places in brooklyn but i kind of keyed in on this building a little while ago. i was reading a bunch about all the new buildings in the area and this one has the most positive reviews and the best location. i saw the unit yesterday, not too good to be true.

**Version B**:
I checked out some other Brooklyn spots, but I've actually had my eye on this particular building for a while now. I've been doing a lot of research on the new developments in the area, and this one seems to have the best reviews and location. I went to see the apartment yesterday - it's pretty nice, not one of those "too good to be true" situations.

### PAIR 3: Job inquiry email

**Version A**:
well its the middle of my final quarter of the year at school again and I have yet another new plan for the future. I was originally planning, if you recall from last summer, to get a lab job for the summer because i wouldnt need to make any money because i should have saved money. Well when i quit my job at school and didnt get another one, saving was out of the question.

**Version B**:
So here I am in my final quarter of school with another new plan for what's next. Originally, like I mentioned last summer, I was thinking I'd get a lab job since I wouldn't need to worry about money - I should have saved enough by then. But then I quit my campus job and didn't find another one, so saving money definitely didn't happen like I planned.

### PAIR 4: Hockey plans with friend (2014)

**Version A**:
Maybe i can come up, but more for your birthday and less to like you know, do whatever this thing is. I dont think the winter classic is gonna work; my family wants to go to LA for christmas so we'll be there till NYE and then i'm coming back to new york. I mean, i probably could change the tickets but not sure yet.

**Version B**:
I might be able to come up, but mostly for your birthday rather than whatever this event is. The winter classic probably won't work out - my family's planning to go to LA for Christmas, so we'll be there through New Year's Eve before I head back to New York. I could probably change my flights, but I'm not certain yet.

### PAIR 5: Random banter about motorcycles (2012)

**Version A**:
the worst part of the nice weather is the 1000% increase in motorcycles who don't feel the need to muffle their exhaust systems. househunters international in dusseldorf. damn, and i was just about to go to sleep.

**Version B**:
You know what sucks about the nice weather? All these motorcycles that suddenly appear and don't seem to think they need mufflers. It's like a 1000% increase in noise pollution. And now you're talking about House Hunters International in Dusseldorf? Great, there goes my chance of getting to sleep anytime soon.

---

### PAIR 6: Financial logistics question

**Version A**:
did your login/password change? it doesnt seem to work. i think we just invested in S&P 500 anyway so it doesnt feel like it should matter but this website/program is so crappy that id still like to check.

**Version B**:
Hey, did your login or password change recently? I can't seem to get it to work. We probably just put everything in the S&P 500 anyway, so it might not even matter that much, but this website/program is so terrible that I'd still like to be able to check what's going on.
