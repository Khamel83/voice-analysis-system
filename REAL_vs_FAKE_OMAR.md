### PAIR 1: Responding to professor about cheating accusation

**Version A**:
This comes as a real shock. I really do need to talk to you and will be in your office right after Chemistry on Friday. Hope to be able to talk to you and resolve this issue quickly.

**Version B**:
Wow, this is pretty shocking news. I definitely need to discuss this with you in person - I'll come by your office right after my Chemistry class on Friday. Hopefully we can talk things through and get this sorted out quickly. The thing is, I want to understand what happened and clear this up as soon as possible.

### PAIR 2: Email about research assistant position

**Version A**:
Dear Mrs. Kim, My name is Omar Zoheri, and I was referred to you by Alison Baulos. She informed me that you were looking for more research assistants at the hospital and told me that to email you. I am a first year student concentrating in Pre-Med/Biology. I am very familiar with research work and have done much research in the past. I am available from 1130-130 on Monday and Wednesday, from 1130-300 on Thursday and 1130-5 on Friday. If you are still looking for assistants we may be able to get together and discuss the possibilities.

**Version B**:
Hey Mrs. Kim, I'm Omar Zoheri - Alison Baulos actually suggested I reach out to you about the research assistant position at the hospital. I'm a first-year Pre-Med/Biology student and I've got quite a bit of research experience already, which I'm pretty excited about. My schedule is Monday/Wednesday 11:30-1:30, Thursday 11:30-3:00, and Friday 11:30-5:00 if you're still looking for help. I'd love to meet up and chat about the possibility of working together if you're interested.

### PAIR 3: Confirming interview details

**Version A**:
Dear Mrs. Kim, I just looked back and read that you wanted a response about the interview that you scheduled for today, and I will be more than glad to be there at 4pm. I am very sorry for the delay, and am now very glad I went back to re-read the email. I will be sure to bring the directions and not get lost. Hope to see you at 4pm today.

**Version B**:
Hey Mrs. Kim, I just realized I never replied to your email about the interview today - I'll definitely be there at 4pm! Sorry for the delay, I'm really glad I went back and re-read your message. I'll make sure to bring the directions so I don't get lost on my way there. Looking forward to meeting you at 4pm today!

### PAIR 4: Challenging a grade

**Version A**:
Dear Mr. Jarrell, My name is Omar Zoheri and am currently enrolled in the Chem 110's sequence, and have a question as to my grade of last quarter. Although I received a grade atleast one SD above the mean on both midterms and felt I did fairly well on the final and did well in Lab, I still received a B- for the quarter, and feel that that grade is not up to my calculations of how well I performed in the class. My lab TA, Tom Rammer, told me to contact you as to discuss this matter. If you could please respond to me with either a clarification of my grade or when we could get together and discuss it, It would be greatly appreciated.

**Version B**:
Hey Mr. Jarrell, I'm in your Chem 110 sequence and I'm hoping you could help me understand my grade from last quarter. I scored at least one standard deviation above the mean on both midterms, felt pretty good about the final, and did well in lab - but I ended up with a B- for the quarter. That doesn't really match up with how I thought I performed in the class. My lab TA, Tom Rammer, suggested I reach out to you to discuss this. I'd appreciate it if you could either clarify my grade or let me know when we might meet to talk about it. Thanks!
