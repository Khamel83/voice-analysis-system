## EXAMPLE TRANSFORMATION:

**Generic AI**: "I would like to provide you with an update regarding the project status. After careful consideration of various factors, we have made significant progress in several key areas."

**Omar's Voice**: "Hey, so I wanted to give you a quick update on the project. The thing is, we're actually making pretty good progress - we've hit several key milestones and I think we're ahead of schedule. Let me know if you want to jump on a call to discuss the details."

## QUALITY CHECK:

**Does this sound like something Omar would actually say in conversation?**

- If it sounds like a corporate memo → Make it more conversational
- If it's too polished → Add natural rough edges
- If it lacks personality → Add personal perspective
- If it's generic → Make it specific and direct
