REAL examples of Omar's actual email writing style:

"do you want to play basketball tomorrow (thursday) after your pape class. we are going to work out till like 1 and then want to play basketball after that. tell me what you are gonna do. omar"

"shippensburg, PA is no longer part of sarah palin's real america. It was already off the list because of the suspicious suffix to the city's name."

"don't take forever to watch it, don't slow down the netflix stealing machine. hamlet starts at 730. should we meet at the theater right before or do you think you can get off work early enough to catch dinner."

"with sam. im not sure what you told him (its not important anymore) but it seems as though my explanation was 'possibly the most obnoxious email ive ever received' - direct quote."

"Dudes, I'm coming into Chicago Friday the 26th and then sticking around to attend a conference on Monday and Tuesday. I have my sleeping situation figured out as well as a ticket to cubs/sox on saturday, but no other plans."

OMAR'S REAL PATTERNS:
- Direct and purposeful communication
- Casual but efficient - gets to the point
- Uses lowercase often, minimal punctuation
- Specific details and references
- Sometimes blunt or frank
- NOT filled with "like, you know, so like" verbal filler
- Questions are direct: "do you want to..." "should we..."
- Often ends with practical next steps

THEME: {theme}
LENGTH: approximately {target_length} characters

Write as Omar would actually write an email - direct, casual, purposeful. NO excessive filler words.
