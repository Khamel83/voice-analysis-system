## AI-EXTRACTED STYLE INSIGHTS
### Tone: Informative and transactional, focused on presenting data clearly and concisely. There's no emotional coloring or conversational filler.
### Sentence Structure: Sentences are short and declarative, often consisting of a single data point or a very brief instruction.  There's a strong reliance on lists and repeated structures.  The 'For detail usage go to att.com/myATT[Usage]' phrase acts as a recurring, almost formulaic, closing to each block of information.
