Okay, so is this actually in the code or just in the evals.md file? Either way, I just want to sort of know what I'm dealing with.
11:59 AM
Remember, we don't only just process podcasts. We process tons of stuff, so if what you're saying is this will work per piece of content, then that's fine, but let's just think about how to incorporate this.
11:56 AM
Okay, I don't really quite understand everything. The reason I listen to the podcast is it's an old coworker of mine, and so are our logs. Do we need to have all these different logs? Is that the right way to do this? If so, can all of this go somewhere like I want to be able to read a single file and then sort of figure this out. Is this all updated in that evils.md file? I just want to be able to sort of come back to this later.
11:55 AM
Okay, well let's update our documentation, push this to GitHub, and then we can call it a day.
11:54 AM
Yeah, I mean, it's not even asking you to propose axial codes. I just want to make sure we actually have a log file. Is there a log file that's just logging everything that we're doing that we can use to look at? Or do we not actually have that? We don't have a CSV, like none of this is actually created, this is just an idea. I just want to make sure we actually have the information required to even do this.
11:28 AM
From just testing to everything, 55% success rate is still a lot lower than I was expecting, but you know it's better than zero. So for everything in the queue that is not already identified, can we put it through this process? What is it going to take for me to actually trust you that this is happening?
11:26 AM
use cloud code for coding, and I wanna you know I'm always getting and receiving terminal (sorry, shell) scripts, and then I often have issues - it doesn't work, it works, it doesn't work. If I can say you know I use whatever Sonoma or whatever the not Tahoe but the reason the OS before Tahoe for Mac, and what I'm trying to figure out is I don't really like as you can tell I don't really know what's exactly what I'm talking about here, but I want to be able to write the same thing on my Mac as my OCM Raspberry Pi and so on and so forth. So I'm trying to sort of figure out like you know I have them now all SSH to each other, but I want to find a way - is there a way to make things easier? Can I just say you know to an AI assistant I always want to use posi X or portable POSI X. Like I'm just trying to figure out a way to use Mac and Ubuntu and it's mainly those two in a way that this sort of rational.
Yesterday
03:15 PM
Let's add in way more quick questions in AI-powered analysis, ideally based on the actual data so you can do some high-level grouping and summing to come up with questions that would actually get asked. I wanted to just show either 6 random ones every time for both the quick questions and the AI-powered analysis or the most relevant ones, but I wanna spend a little bit of time now with you figuring out what is useful.
03:13 PM
Okay, so when I put a ton more data in there, it shouldn't be super huge, but did we finish all the testing? Are we sure that it's working? I want to make sure that it's working. I know this was a tangent about the database, but I just want to be sure.
03:09 PM
We're not losing anything. We're not making anything up. We're not deleting anything. It's both compression and database technology and schema, but we have everything. Is there anything being lost?
03:09 PM
And to be clear, we're sure that we took 2.5 GB of Excel files and it really does just go down to a 95 MB database, correct?
02:48 PM
Audio is silent.
01:51 PM
Time off data. Yeah, I might want it per employee. I might want it for a specific time off type. Which `time_off_plan` represents actual vacation? That is one of those questions I don't have an answer to right now. I would want for a compensation data, yeah, all positions per employee if they have multiple jobs. It doesn't happen too often, but it is necessary to consider that. Demographics table, that's probably not something we're going to use a ton, but I wanted to give it because we have it. I don't have Workday documentation for stuff like CF, INIT. That's probably something kind of specific. So that's the kind of stuff you should compile so that I can have my team explain.
01:50 PM
Again, I assume a lot of this stuff is pretty standard workday stuff. If it's not, then we need to sort of think through it. If you need to ask me questions, let's ask questions. Let's put together a list of questions that I can have my team do. They don't need to know why I'm doing it; I can just tell them what to do. But I do want to make sure we understand. I only gave you a handful of rows. I don't want you to make assumptions based on only 99-100 rows. If I need to give you a bunch more, I can, especially if I know this is all being done on my machine.

Let's post, let's make sure that we have our `OLLAMA_MODEL_GUIDE` for this file, for this project updated because I'm going to have to switch to a different model, and I don't want to lose a lot of this context or information.
01:48 PM
And also I'm fine continuing with llama3.2 3b. You seem to think it's fine. It has a proven track record that one I know. So let's keep that. Let's keep that in the requirements.txt but I just want to figure out the schema thing. I do fear that at some point we're going to need to utilize smarter modeling to do stuff, so I really want this schema table or file or whatever it is to be super duper detailed so that we can just send that to an LLM along with the question and have it produce something useful for us as opposed to something different. Again, don't mess with the data right? Like we need to figure out what that is. I want you not to start guessing or cleaning things up; they don't clean it's cleaned. The reason there are probably duplicate rows is this a difference in elements? Most of them have `employee_id`, but not all tables do. This is why we need to sort of talk through the schema because some of these things are employee-based, some of them are at a different level, some of them are not employee-specific. You know, there's a lot of different aspects of this data, and you never asked me any of this stuff, so I assumed you were able to figure it out. But if you're not, then let's kind of think through this.
01:47 PM
I'll try to be more precise than that, but how much explanation do I need to do for each of these columns? Do you have a definition, a clear definition for every column? Are you rationalizing the data? I know there's a lot of data that is just being repeated over and over again, and for a specific person, it doesn't necessarily change. Like, ID12345 should always be the same one person, but I don't know how we're handling all the metadata, demographic data, some data that stays the same, some data that changes, etc.
01:43 PM
I really need to figure out how do we resolve this schema context issue? The 1-second difference is not a big deal, the smaller footprint is not a big deal, but why would I not want SQL cleaner SQL style? Is it just style or actual results? I don't particularly care about Google vs Meta or anything like that. These are open-source models, so what I'm really trying to figure out is what's the best one that I should be using. I don't know if I have enough from your guide; it seems like LLAMA 3.2 3B is just the best one, and I don't know why I would test GEMMA 2 if I already tested GEMMA 3. So, what do we need to do to fix this schema issue? Because I want it to be a big constraint, and if it needs to be manual that's fine, but what do we need to do?
01:41 PM
And also, I might have missed it, but are we saying we don't need to switch to Gemma, or did that get lost in translation? I still want to do the comparison between Gemma and LLaMA.
01:40 PM
And again, the fact that sometimes it produces inaccurate sequel is sort of the whole reason I keep asking about you know how messy how precise should we use another model. Again I'm not saying we need to I just want to make sure that we have really clear schema and design so that this doesn't keep happening.
01:38 PM
OK, so um it'll be yeah I'm not going to delete the file I'm just saying from my machine, like I don't think we're going back to these files once they're in the `usc_hr_analytics`.db file, we're not going back to those files, so they can sort of live on the server or something. I don't need to have them taking up space on my machine. All I would need is one-time setup to get all the historical stuff, and then ongoing, I added, but that's it, right? Um, and then I should be able to use the web interface to query the database, and theoretically, I could just give this database to another person on my team, or give this entire project along with the database to another person on my team, one of the analysts, and they could do this as well. I want to prove that this works; I'm not looking to fire anybody; I just kind of want to see if there's a way that we can do our job better. Even if I don't tell anybody about it, that's fine, but I want to sort of understand what the constraints, limits, so on and so forth are, and use the right database, the right models for what we're doing.
01:37 PM
To be clear, once we have this sort of database set up, we don't need the historical files right? We're like ingesting the data into a database, normalizing it, cleaning it up, and basically creating what's in effect a local SQL database with all this information. Is that right or am I missing something?
01:34 PM
How precise or imprecise can I or do I need to be when asking these questions? Like, if I just copy an email I got from a leader and paste it into the `web_interface`, is Gemma3 or Llama or whatever smart enough to figure it out? Or do we still require some process to use a smarter model to turn the question that comes in into the type of prompt that is required for these local models, if that makes any sense?
12:15 PM
While I wait to get the historical data, how is this being processed locally? I didn't give you an API key, so how are we actually doing the LLM integration? Where is that coming from? I didn't tell you which model to do, maybe I missed it somewhere, but you know, I do have Olama on this machine, so are you telling me it should be fine with whatever Llama models I already have on here. I think I have Goodness what do I have? I have Quen 3.8b, I have Deep Seek r18b, I have probably Llama 3.23b, um, you know, I have 16 gigs of ram, so I can whatever can run on 16 gigs of ram. I guess but Can or should this be done locally? You know, if you could tell me yeah a hundred percent of what you need can be done locally then even better speed is not a huge concern as long as it's not gonna take half an hour to do this kind of stuff but I do want to think about that
12:10 PM
And don't forget, once this is sort of working or conceptually working, I want to be able to just paste into this exact same folder all the folders and all the data that I have, and be assured that none of it— not a single solitary row ever goes anywhere outside my computer. That at no point is anything ever exposed. So again, that can be plan three or phase three or whatever I don't care, but I want to make sure that we have a plan for all this.
12:07 PM
How can we make sure that all the data stays secure, hidden, and never goes anywhere but we create a schema layer that can go to an external LLm provider like GPT-5 or Claude Sonnet to help us formulate the query that we can run on our local database. So no data ever leaves the machine but we can use models that are not on the machine to actually do the hard work of answering the questions (e.g. what's the average salary for faculty and then what's their accrued vacation balances and so on and so forth). We might need to create a much more detailed plan, schema mapping, and a complicated way of organizing the data. Once we have it, we should be able to utilize LLms to come up with answers to any kind of question that we have. I would love for this to be a locally hosted web page where we can just type in the question and the answer shows up. Ideally, and what I would love to happen but this is a future thing, not a today thing, is for you to also provide me with how it was done so that if somebody asks, "Which source file did you use? What queries did you run?" you can be like, "If you wanted to recreate this, you open up this file, you open up these 10 files, you combine them together, you group them, sum them, pivot whatever it is like you can explain that. But that's not a today thing."
10:24 AM
I don't have this project running on my Mac, so I need a specific file. I'm not sure this monitoring is required; I don't need you to do anything other than connect Velja to Atlas. Does that require this monitoring script? It's not something I can do from Velja and have it just push to Atlas. I just want to make sure I understand what's going on here.
09:40 AM
And let's make sure to track this in Archon as well.
09:37 AM
One thing I was thinking about is I don't know if you saved this, probably didn't. But I'm using this program (I'll give you a link for it), which I use to download things (mostly videos). What I want to figure out is whether we can use it as another way to take in documentation. In other words, if it's a video, it just uses its standard process, and you might have to tell me how to make these changes in the actual code. But if it's a video, it goes through and does what its own thing does. If this process finds a URL, then it goes into Atlas. I know this is a little bit vague, but are you sort of following? I kind of want to use this service which does a good job of storing things offline, using my iCloud and all that other stuff, so that even if Atlas isn't running or even if the server isn't running, it's doing the one thing I wanted to do: it always saves the link, no matter if it's a minute or 10 minutes or two hours or two days or two weeks. When the server starts running again on my Mac, it always has it there. So, what's the best way to go about this? I want to keep working on the Podcasts part, but I want to make this its own project and think through how to utilize this program and all the documentation and searches and everything you can do about it to be another ingestion point. So that when I send a link from my phone, I already have the whole workflow to send to my Mac. When I go send it to my Mac, either if it's a video it just opens up and does what it already does, and if it's a URL it goes to Atlas.
September 23, 2025
05:07 PM
It's not Atlas integration; it's to use the same features, ideas, and thoughts from these programs to allow me to have a reliable way of sending in links. That's really my main focus. But if there's anything we can learn from these other apps, that would be great.
September 20, 2025
11:10 PM
Sure, let's do Emergency TTS Fallback. I'm fine with that. I don't care. And it can just be the robot. Like it can just be, "Well, that's fine." You should test it, I'll test it at the end.

Sure, I don't know what the simple character counting for core awareness is, but if you say that's all I don't want any logging, all we're logging is in a sort of a SQLite database or whatever. Whatever the time period is (if it's from today for 30 days or whatever) - just log how much talking is happening, and if we hit the limit, I don't know - just make a simple screen saying "Monthly usage point" or something to tell my son that he's running he's hitting a limit. He'll just tell me, "Hey dad, it's time to talk to your parent about this." But you give him I'm saying, "Yeah, we're okay with all this." Let's assume that all the work is being done by some agent that is pretty smart but is not omniscient, so if we just tell it exactly what we need to do, it will do it.

Let's first get this plan - this file I don't know if we have a name for the file `FINAL_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN`.md, okay if that's really what it is, then fine. Let's get this thing perfect, and then I want to see I always want to be able to see where we are in a to-do list in cloud code, so make sure that that is added to the plan somehow or some shape. I always want to be able to see basically where if there's 10 steps we're 1 out of 10, or if there's 20 steps we're 1 out of 20, or if there's 13 steps but whatever. But at the end, the final step should always be "Update documentation, push to `GitHub`," and you know, closing it out. But we should be pushing to `GitHub` pretty frequently, even if it's only to local and then to remote every once in a while.

From now on, I want you to run it non-interactively. I don't want to say anything else. The next thing for me to say is "I used it, and this is my feedback."
10:59 PM
Again, I would love to pay zero dollars for this. So is there a version of this at `ElevenLabs` that is free? Again, even if it's only you can only use an hour a day, I'm never gonna even get close to that.
10:58 PM
Again to be clear, this is the bare minimum: it has to sound basically as good as `OpenAI`. Not in the sense that it just has to sound like a person, not like a very Stephen Hawking robot.
10:58 PM
Alright, I tested this before. Sounded horrible. Are you telling me maybe I just did a bad implementation?
10:57 PM
Maybe a better way to do this is to integrate text-to-speech? Because that's the part that you know, speech-to-text we have, but it's the text-to-speech that I'm using `OpenAI`. I feel like I've given you the right `apiKey`. I don't know what else to do. But like, is there something I should be doing or a better way to be doing this speech-to-text? It's either more cost-efficient or it's really bored. I don't know what else to do.
10:34 PM
Um again, this keeps happening. What I was asking you to do is to develop the OOS documentation so that I can copy a URL that's hosted on Github and paste it into Cloud Code for any project, and it understands that just based on the fact that there's a README with a link to this file on my Github for this project OOS, the AI will understand that "hey, you're being asked to implement this project into your code purely for development". Do that and then start using OOS as middleware as soon as possible. If you have to exit and come back, that's just like literally all it says is "hey, you know, what cloud code should ideally respond back to the user would be: 'Hey, do you know your operate you want to integrate OOS? Are you good with this?' They say yes, it does it, and at the end, if it needs environmental variables or whatever or restart or whatever it does, just tells it to do that. And then going forward while using cloud code, it will have OOS enabled as development, not for the product itself. So when we're in that place, when you have that, then we're done. You got to tell me what we're going to need to do to get from there where we are now to there.
10:30 PM
In general, this more or less makes sense. I think one thing about the OOS that was just intended to be used for development, not incorporating into the project. I think our documentation was bad, but that's something I can deal with later. The other thing about the `apiKey` - there is an intentionally two different API keys: the `apiKey` for `OpenRouter` which is providing the Wispr sync, and the actual AI modeling is being done via `OpenRouter` with Google Flash (whatever we have now). Sorry, actually we do not have `OpenAI` again for the nano um, and so that's on purpose. I'm trying to use my `OpenRouter` tokens for AI. And about the actual product itself, again I'm disagreeing on a single AI provider, but we can talk about that later. I'm fine with SymFly voice direct audio content filtering again. I don't want it to be too brittle. I'm okay with prompts like this. This has to work. I'm not that worried about him doing anything bad. I'm not super worried about offline fallback. If there's something that can be done easily where it works offline, great. We were having text display so my son can read responses. That was like part of the original one that I built months ago. I don't care about the parental dashboard, I don't care about emergency stop. I don't even know what that means. It just needs to work like it used to just work fine. I just want to try to make it better, and then we sort of totally went off track. Again, I'm fine with personality modes, learning topics, progress tracking, but again, this is all ephemeral - nothing's being saved. I don't want to save any logging. I just wanted to work for like you said, my 6-year-old son, 100% of the time. So incorporate all this into your plan. You have everything you need from me. I guess I need to give you the API keys which just got lost somewhere. There will be an `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` and a um `apiKey` from `OpenAI`.
10:27 PM
Yeah, I think both you and the Claude code look totally misunderstood. I was trying to implement this in this project, not for a kid. I'm developing this kid-friendly AI, it's not has nothing to do with the project itself, this is literally just for development. So maybe that's what sort of got lost, and I'm wondering, I have to pull this whole thing back. Can we do this again? I think you sort of misunderstood my ask.
04:06 PM
Well, what about the AI not actually working with chat? It seems like a big deal for a chatbot.
September 18, 2025
11:56 PM
I mean, I think the big unlock here is I'm not using my Freedom Unlimited nearly enough. I use my Chase Sapphire Reserve the way you tell me to use my Freedom Unlimited, but seems like I should for Target. I actually have a Target 5% card, so that's what I use for Target. But I'll probably spend more at Amazon unless a target, but it's you know a wash and it really is freedom unlimited which already no no no Amazon Visa Amazon of course and winning any whole foods I do which is almost nothing but MX Gold for dining and groceries so that one I'll bring with me put in my Apple wallet for dining and groceries and take with me when I go out. But it seems like I should be daily carrying the Freedom Unlimited in the MX Gold. That kind of makes the most sense. And how much is the United Explorer card going up to used to be 99. Maybe that was just the first year. Um yeah so I'm going to apply for the MX Gold use it for dining and groceries use the Chase Sapphire for Travel which you know I may be doing more of or less of I don't exactly know um but I'll definitely do enough to make the card worth it um but seems like there's no specific need to use any other cards though right there's no you know like all my other random cards are just keeping around um but it's basically the Freedom Unlimited to Chase Sapphire Reserve for Travel and then the you know Amazon Special Card and Target Special Card for those but then groceries and dining or MX Gold for now and Freedom Unlimited for everything else. So I sort of getting that right every other card kind of doesn't have a sometimes they'll use the Freedom um rotating 5% when it makes sense but I think that's what I gotta I gotta just get everything to the Freedom Unlimited.
06:53 PM
Please give me the file again. It's not working. It's not showing up.
06:52 PM
Are you sure? I mean, this is like the seventh time. Because I can see that when I say something, eventually stops. Again, it's still echoing the microphone. It seems to be using a more intense version of microphone or plays a sound or something.

Before it was just you press the button to talk and you would just talk and you wouldn't hear anything. And now I'm hearing some sort of reverb. So I don't know what's going on there, but I want to make sure that we have it actually work, you know? It's just not working.
06:50 PM
Still broken man. Still says the same issue. Oh, so frustrating. I was really hoping this was gonna be fixed, but now I've broken it even further.
06:48 PM
I want you to tighten the mapping, like yeah, I don't want Google One and Google Photos to be separate. I mean, that one actually specifically I don't care, I do care because Google One is a service and Google Photos almost always buys photos, but yeah, like collapse the banks, like I don't need to see a million different Bank of America or Chase's. I just need to see Bank of America ATM and know that it's an ATM. That's what I'm trying to figure out here. Can we like the formatting is fine, the information you did an okay job, some of the Ally Bank is actually you seem to do, and Amazon is fine, so some of these you did well and some you didn't
06:47 PM
I didn't even have to do anything with this. I can see that you— I don't know what you think you're doing, but like… Alexa skills random digits with a space and stuff after it is the same. They're Alexa skills. The digits after it, like, you're not going— You're not thinking. So like that's— So I have to write like a Python script to come up with like a loop so that instead of you looking at all of them, you're looking at a single, you know, either chunk or single 5 single row at a time to cleanse it. And then a second one to like de-normalize it. Because like Alexa skills, random digits is just like Amazon. Random digits I don't care about the random digits. Like that's the whole point of this. So can we think about another way to do this?
06:39 PM
This might not be a 100% perfect, but it should give you enough information to do what I asked you.

First, before you do anything else, confirm you understand what I'm asking you to do. Let's answer any questions that are required.

Next, I want to drop in this is what you drop into CloudDocs to get started. Obviously, you have to manage it. I'm not saying I won't, but to get started, and this is what I need to know when anything else. I'm going to use my preview units now. They should be able to play anything - I don't need to buy any or connect any device to it to just beep or say "Got it, sir" or whatever.

I'll use the Google Homes because I have them. I have two of them somewhere in this house. I don't even have one of them plugged in. The other ones are still in the box. As long as I can use them, I'll use them, and when they die, I'll live without or I'll find a replacement like this WIM Pro.

But like, you know, I want you to sort of figure this out for me, and I'm fine using the existing ones. They're all here, so I'm not I don't need to throw them the garbage. I just don't want to invest in them for anything other than them just doing the free stuff that they currently do (play Spotify and whatever). If I can put in their room right next to it a device that they can talk to, and I don't have to pay for Alexa kids or Alexa pro or any other shit, and it's all either local or managed by me (in my Oracle VM or with my open router tokens), I'm fine with that powering my you know, that's what I'm saying. This has got to be like a super base. So I'm going to look into this. You keep saying no one's done it. Believe me.
06:38 PM
Okay, what exactly can you give me? Let's say these two devices show up tomorrow. One's gonna be upstairs, one's gonna be downstairs. Can you either give me the exact workflow or the approximate workflow plus the exact prompt for Claude code to manage this? I can give you more context. Actually, I will hear about my network, and then you can help me figure out what the code would be.
06:35 PM
I have one, and probably another one for sure, and I could buy more. I have the Google Audios. Those things you could plug into a 3.5mm thing to play music, and they were Google Endpoints. That's still supported, right? I mean, I know it is still supported for now, I still use it, but like… Would that be a good use case here? And if I did that? Would that let me use it to replace an Alexa entirely?
06:31 PM
All right, so about the preview unit - two of them. I'm going to try to put one in between the living room and the kitchen. We'll see how good the mics are. If not, I'll get another one. Doesn't seem to make sense to buy a ton at a time if I'm going to buy one more. I'd probably buy two or three more and just put them everywhere. It seems like if they have a 3.5mm line out, I can plug in a $20, $10, $50, or $1000 speaker and that can be this unit's out, effectively getting rid of the smart devices entirely. Like I've replaced the Alexa or the Google or whatever with my own, and that's it - this is entirely replacing my smart devices with home assistant and whatever. Presumably it can turn on. I buy mostly name-brand stuff, so like Casa and I have some huge stuff I might replace and I have some weird stuff that some random thing I found on Amazon for my kid's room lights, but they have an app, so I'm guessing they'll work with home assistants, or I can just replace them. This is what I'm doing. Does it connect to Alexa to play music, or if not Alexa, Google Home, and if not that, Google Music, or whatever, or you're going to even Apple Music because if we can connect to Spotify, that solves my use for the kids (playing music) and my use for me (also playing music). I'm assuming it can do timers and just remember stuff and stuff like that. Is all of this again possible?
06:19 PM
Bro, this is actually out okay, so I can buy it right now. Let's just buy three. I can buy it on Americandroid.com for 50 some odd books, but let's see what it actually costs. It's 200 bucks for three of them. Presumably, would not be any different if I ordered four. This is what I should get this home assistant voice preview. It's better than the ESP. I don't care about the screen. Cool. I'm not that concerned about privacy. I'm not doing any crazy stuff like I should care more about privacy. Fine. But like, for now, I'm not that worried about it. If this preview edition is the sound good enough to replace an Alexa, or can I just probably just use the Alexa as playing music and just use this for all the smarts. I can basically just use it to answer the other thing I want to have an answer to: Has somebody else figured this out on Github to create a family assistant where each person's wake word is different? Let's say mine is "Jeffrey" and then my son's is "Artemis" and my daughter's is "Mini". Each of us gets our own thing. My daughter is 3, so she gets a 3-year-old's version of AI which is like just collecting information that she says to it and just being pleasant. My son gets a 6-year-old version which is just like every time he says a bad word it says "don't say that", otherwise it just kind of goes along to get along. In my version is whatever I want, and but like, the kids are always around, so I would have to have two versions: one for me alone, and one for me with the kids. The one with me with the kids just does what I wanted to do but doesn't have full access, so I don't care as much about the cost. I care more about how does this actually work and has somebody else figured this out.
06:12 PM
Okay, here it is as a CSV file. I want the deliverable to be a 3-column CSV file:



Exactly what I just gave you


A normalized name (there are 25 different versions of Amazon in here, a lot of the same things that mean the same thing but have all this weird additional information)


If we determine the additional information that's useful, it should just be like notes. If it says Amazon-12345 in the first column, the second column will say Amazon, and the third column will say "what for Amazon is the that information", and if it's just not worth it, then says nothing. But if it says, you know, like I don't know you should be able to determine so I don't really care what's in the notes as long as the first column is exactly what's in this CSV file and the second column is a harmonized, normalized, cleansed version of the first one.


06:09 PM
I'm slightly confused about this decision on what to use as the device, the Atom Echo. But maybe I'm dumb. What I want is the most detailed summary of this entire thing. I don't need the back-and-forth; I kind of need where we ended up. What I need to do is understand why this all makes sense. It's good to know it compares to other programs, but like I kind of want the more practical: What am I getting? What is it costing me? What is the upgrade like? Worried this information is not accurate, but like, what's the next option I could buy? There was one that had a little screen; I didn't care that it had a screen; it just had more microphones. I'm not opposed to spending $150 on 350 devices if that's better. I don't want to spend $15 on more garbage or things that are a good idea but now I have 4 of them. What am I going to do with them? Like, let's just think through that. Give me a summary so I can process this later. I want to have this all in one place.
06:08 PM
The talking, and it's just busted man. Like, the games are probably fine or close to fine, but the chat, the actual AI buddy doesn't work anymore. Still, I hit talk, I still see it here in Echo. Now it says "unexpected token" I id zero, data is not invalid JSON, so I'm assuming that's just like a back-end error. But I'm really frustrated. The buddy.camel.com works perfectly; it goes right here, so that's fantastic! I never have to remember this again, but um yeah, this is frustrating.
06:03 PM
I vaguely remember something about these atoms being underpowered, so just make sure that's not or like the speaker is being really bad. I wanted to have the same which I know is not gonna happen with this ability to be across the room and it hears me the same way that any of the smart speakers do. I'm less worried about the even if you can just beep or make any kind of sounds that's fine with me in terms of its native ability, but that I don't care about if they can connect a Bluetooth speaker great and if they can even you know have a 3.5mm connection to something you know fine like you know that's the way I want to work with it.

And then like, is this something is this a project which it feels like somebody else has figured out somebody knows somebody has on Github exactly how to do this whole thing. If that's correct I want you to tell me like what it's going to take to do this. Is this something that you or an AI agent given you know pseudo access on my Mac mini or my OCI or my Raspberry Pi or whatever could execute because they're already all SSH together through Tail Scale so I can access any one of them from any one of them.
05:56 PM
Oh yeah, something else. I'm definitely going to at some point figure out Home Assistant. So like, um. It seems like the Adam Echo might be a little bit too. Is that the one that's like not the speakers are bad? Thinking of something else? No, maybe, maybe these first two are just the two I was looking at before. My preference is actually to use that if unless there's a reason not to, to use the OCI virtual machine because why not? Somebody else is managing it. I don't need this for to be near 100% reliable. My devices are way less than 100% reliable. That's the bigger problem I'm running into. So like, if it makes sense to be done locally, it should be done on the Raspberry Pi (I guess was like throttling or something), so I gotta figure that out, and then the Mac mini in terms of reliability. But if it makes sense or needs to be done on the Mac mini, it can be.

Let's assume I'm going to use you. Tell me which one of the two devices is better, the Atom or the ESP Home, and how is this all going to work together? Exactly in terms of the cost. I'm not like if we're talking about you know a million tokens a month that's a quarter, so if this is a million tokens let's just assume it can all be done on Open Router (even if it's honestly 10 million tokens they can be done on Open Router). I don't think it's going to be that much a month. And then let's yeah let's figure out like what's the actual cost to buy let's say for now three of these and then obviously I can make some incremental costs for additional ones. What should I buy as sort of like you know in the same way I've had some of these Amazon devices for almost 10 years and they still work, they don't really like they just do what they said they're going to do and nothing more. What should I buy if I'm looking for that and I want to be able to put them in other rooms and have that option in my kid's room and I get rid of there. Echoes, even if I have like an additional little speaker connected to it because I'm assuming the speaker on the device is pretty bad. That's just now like a personal AI implementation, and each kid can have their own wake word. And if it can even honestly like determine their voices in any sort of like vague way and I can create sort of bespoke AI experiences for each one of them in a different one for me or anybody else that I add. Like is this all possible?
05:53 PM
Yeah, so I have a Mac Mini 16GB. My devices are all on Tailscale. I want to buy. The reason I even learned about these ESP32 S3 boards is I was just like trying to figure out how to I have all these Alexas and Google Homes or whatever, and I mainly use them as just speakers. But I kind of wanted to figure out if I can have my own version of that. And if I also have a Raspberry Pi 8GB Raspberry Pi 4 8GB that I can use for this. So like, if I can utilize this stuff. I'd rather pay pennies a month for Google Flash Lite or whatever some OpenRouter model than doing it on device unless there's some specific reason that needs to be done on device (like hardware reasons). But like, I want to basically buy something from somewhere. I'm not trying to build a board or anything like that. I want to buy something that's just kind of like an Alexa that just is a thing I can leave out and like, things like that's not it. It's just like I'm not a maker.
05:51 PM
I'm also thinking of buying these, god ESP-232 or something like that to make my own like I was joking, Jarvis but just put a device in my room and my bedroom which is also my office, the kitchen, and the downstairs living room where we primarily spend most of our time. I can say "Hey, whatever" or whatever the whatever wake word I choose, "add this thing" do this other thing" and they can sort of kick off a set of tasks. Would this help with that? Again, not everything's about me being a dad; I'm just saying that is my reality. And yes, I would love to do everything for free, like I love to create this for free, and if I want to spend a little bit of money on a better model, but you know, buying the hardware obviously but I can make it even better. It's a way to sort of connect with all this and another sort of way is like, is this sort of like a useful thing? Like, is this a useful thing for me to learn and understand? You know, it seems like being open source it should be supported, it's already supported by a bunch of people like Pydantic and Krew.ai and whatever, so that's fine but I'm trying to figure out like what I can get out of this.
05:49 PM
So kind of like, how can I use all this? Let's say I have my. I want to basically figure out what's the usefulness of figuring this out? Because like, what are the frontends I can use this for? Again, I'm not trying to make money. I'm a single dad with two young kids. See them half the month after a week or whatever and I'm interested in making these changes, but uh, I'm trying to figure out like, you know, this would be a smart idea for a business. But I'm not looking for more money. I'm not looking. I'm looking for simplification or just fun. Um, so I'm trying to figure out like Pydantic AI, this CopilotKit, like, and OpenRouter - that's my sort of AI provider of choice. Cause I can just pick different models but like, you know, what's the value of all that together?
05:36 PM
Normalize this list of names, combining obvious ones. Return to me with a lookup table of original name, provided here, and sorted cleanse name. If you have any questions, ask me. Use whatever methods you need to know, but this is a solved problem. Somebody on the internet has solved this. You should be able to solve this relatively easily.
05:24 PM
I saw something about if you want to get the most out of the Amex membership rewards. Because again, I'm just trying to milk Amex one more time for annual sign-up bonuses. Like, that's my game now. I feel like I have enough cards. I feel like the Chase Sapphire Reserve is my one sort of like fancy card. So everything else I'm just looking to find new suckers that I can shuffle some of this spending towards for maybe once or twice a year. This is going to be my once for now with this Amex gold. But I heard something about you can't get the Platinum without, if you have the Platinum, you can't go down to the gold. So if you want to get both the gold and the Platinum, you have to do them both or just start at the Platinum.

My question is, even though it seems like I should get rid of this gold, when should I apply for the Platinum card? Or should I apply for the Platinum card? I'm assuming there'll be at some point between now and a year from now, a big sign-up bonus or some reason to sign up for it. But based on my spending and whatever, what would I spend? The CSR exclusive tables again, that's money that's like a guarantee. I'm guaranteed to use that $300.
05:07 PM
I will definitely use both the StubHub credits. Again, I think there are more is the city Costco card free, like you know, some of this Freedom Unlimited 1.5 ultimate rewards. Yeah, so it seems like the Freedom I think you need to use the Freedom Unlimited more often. But yeah, let's add this in there, and then let's sort of do this again. I'm probably going to give you the 12-month categories later, or maybe I'll do it now. But like, let's take this and then I'll see.
05:01 PM
I'm just going to comment this as I go through - this more or less makes sense. I know that 1.5% membership reward conversion to Hyatt is conservative, especially at the Ventana and the really nice places. Hyatt is the new Starwood from 10 years ago. For this year, seems like, and there is another like thought Chase had another reservation credit thing, so can you look into that the Chase FIA Reserve? I thought it had something else similar to the Resy thing with the Amex Gold, or maybe I confused those two, but I thought it had something like that as well. Again, it was like, "oh pick from one of the 25 best restaurants in LA" - it's like, "okay that's where I eat anyways". So let's just add that into the keep.

Leave it again, kind of like you know I want you to sort of help me make the decision. Yeah let's set it and forget it again. I might actually just get our if I get my actual transactions and try to sort of rationalize it. Whatever that'll be, we can just do it at the end. If I give my actual data, we can do a much better job of this matching. Like, if I can just give you the categories (not from the budget) but from my actual spending over the last 12 months, we can do a much better job of coming up with this math.

Is there lounge access with this reserve? I think the one in LA is not anywhere close; it's just like in the International Lounge. But is there anything with the MX Gold?

And then why I should just have to do this next year? If the value of the card this year is I'm buying 100,000 MX rewards points for $325 - whatever I spend, so you know I'm basically buying the points for effectively nothing, and then next year it's going to be similar to the Chase Sapphire reserve, it costs this much, I'm already spending this much, if I can put it in my account and set it and forget it, then or just like you know I know I'm going to always go home for Thanksgiving, so that's always going to be $1000, and I know I'm always going to go to a couple Laker games and a couple of whatever games, so that's money I was going to spend anyways, and then I can just go through the account, set up the right one card, and then every year have to figure it out after that. PC cards to PC probably cancel. You're just telling me to downgrade, so can you just tell me the difference? Like, what am I paying for the United Express? I get that the gateway is free, I can downgrade to that, but like, what am I getting for it? I have two kids, I no longer travel much with bags, so that's not a huge issue. Priority boarding doesn't do a ton; I would sort of prefer to board last. If I can just make each kid be responsible for their own bag or at least have something I can carry that can go under the seat, so like, what's. I already have a. Yeah just on a gate check, so. Can usually be pretty aggressive about that, so like, you know. United is a good route from Chicago from L.A. to Chicago. And my other flights are usually two major cities that United does, and then I'm pretty sure is going to go down into VentureOne. I think this year they give me a free one, so is that the best Capital One card to go down to? But also like. Some of your acronyms and I don't know, like, maybe I should maybe based on like the kind of question I'm asking, I sound like I would know more about this if you skip gold you lose 107 of category uplift plus 1500 it was at the 100000 points.
04:50 PM
Okay, a couple of things on this:



You have I gave you up above my budget, assume what I spend here is annualized, and assume other than my mortgage and my childcare, my cleaning lady, so like a couple thousand bucks are all on um credit cards. Those ones I just mentioned are Zelle, uh or you know wire trend bank transfers or something like that.


And so like what it didn't even make sense to me until just now that you're basically saying whether or not I should keep my Chase Sapphire reserve.




Let's look into that a little bit more. I still want to get this um MX Gold card, get the hundred thousand points, but it has a $325 annual fee, and I already pay for the Chase Sapphire reserve. I kind of want to walk through this, so help me sort of walk through:



For one year, I'm going to pay it, and so um I already know that I can easily use the $100 Resi credit, that one's a no-brainer. Duncan not really, maybe I can let my sister use it or you know like my girlfriend or something. Value that at $25. Uber value that at $20 to say I'll use it twice, and the dining credit again, let's value that at $20.




I want to sort of figure out what's the right mix of features where to put my money. I kind of want to just do this one stuff like you know um travel, I have to make the decision, but there's some stuff I can just like move the auto payment from one to the other. Like I currently have my Disney+ on my Amex because it gives me a $7 credit, and it's been giving it to me for I thought it was gonna be like a couple months, and it's been years now. But you know I want to figure out. I haven't yet been charged the upgraded fee for my Chase Sapphire reserve, so you know I can get out of it if it makes sense. But I have a ton of points, I have about 200,000 Chase points, um so I want to make you know I need to maintain access to those. There was a time where I was getting some multiple but even that I don't remember moving points from my one thing to another or something I don't even know what I'm thinking of, but there was like some multiplier with the Freedom or the Freedom Unlimited card that was beneficial. But like um I definitely use the $300 credit for travel for Chase Sapphire reserve, that's a no-brainer. I'm certainly gonna use $150 every twice a year Stub Hub because I go to a lot of stuff, so like that'll get used. The Apple TV and Apple Music value that at $100, not at $250. Lyft again value that at $25. I use these things sort of like randomly, I almost never did Portal redemptions, or I guess I did, but I most often for years have been just like transferring like a hundred thousand or 150,000 Chase points to Hyatt to basically pay for all my stays, and I probably stay once a year at the Alila Ventana in Big Sur which costs you know a pretty penny and has been going up every time. But yeah, like help me let's assume I'm gonna add the Gold for this year and I'm not gonna get rid of anything that is free. For this year, tell me how to like move my money around, and you have you know roughly what I what I you know my budget is sort of approximate. I can probably pull the actual spending from the year, but it'll be a little bit different going forward, but like let's just use what we have as a as a give in. I do a lot of my supermarket spend either at Ralphs or um I do a lot at Costco, so that should be its own thing, like what's the best card to use at Costco because I spend easily four or five grand at Costco. And then yeah dining just like tell me where I need to be, and like let's just use the real data to figure it out.
04:45 PM
Also unrelated to anything else, I own the domain khamel.com, and I've done this with another project where I have Caddy SSL certificates or whatever with my domain. What do I need to do to make buddy.khamel just automatically go to this for-sale app? Let's add that as a task to our to-do list after this stuff. This is all the end.
04:39 PM
Okay, maybe some product recommendations when we go to the animal `randomAnimal` shouldn't we be able to instead of choosing a different animal, there should be another `randomAnimal`. The learn animal adventure fine again, I don't know why that looks so kind of janky design-wise. I don't mind the emoji, I just think it looks like Excel from 1999 on the animal ventures page. Need to carriage return between the header and the sublines. Animal quiz when you click on it doesn't do anything again, also not sure why we have so few animals. Like, it seems like generating content for this is the trivial part, and I wanted to make sure that it can handle additional ones and it's not written for the 5 or 10 or whatever we already have and can't handle more. So let's think through that again. Like, annual adventure takes over the screen when I go to pattern puzzle I still see the AI bot above the game itself again, there's no randomization of the pattern puzzles. All the games should be randomly in random order unless obviously the order makes sense or are there some sort of progression again, like same thing I guess only for the animal guessing math game and pattern puzzle the game should be above the AI bot, or if we can even put the AI bot to the right. So, you know, even if it's just like when you click on that section then it moves it or something else but like I want it to be there but not sort of be prominent like it is right now. Again, I'm not sure why we have a 2-row, 3-wide grid and then only 4 questions. I would imagine we can either have a 2-by-2 grid or 6 answers or something like that but again I feel like just the total number of animals in our world is a little small which is kind of strange because again like there's got to be a ton of content.
04:38 PM
And obviously I was on the AI bot when I got that error, so I was musin' the internet.
04:37 PM
What is going on with the talk and the stop? This was working fine before. Can we either go to the original code from April or May or whenever or look into alternatives that actually work? Because it was working fine even on an earlier version. So I don't know what's going on.
04:24 PM
I'm getting a network error. Please check your connection when I hit Talk. Again, we've truly lost the thread on something that definitely worked when you first took this over.
04:22 PM
Animal quiz doesn't do anything. Clicking on it doesn't do anything. "Learn about animals" is great. When I click on any animal, I click on "Learn more." It doesn't do anything. I'm not sure what I was supposed to do.

I'm not super sure how "Random animal" and "Learn about animals" are any different; they seem to be the exact same thing. So maybe there's something missing or broken there.

Also, we need to randomize the questions - the order of the questions and it just needs to be way more questions. Don't forget 6-year-olds don't have anything else going on; this is all they do think about, so he's going to notice that pretty quickly.
04:21 PM
Seems like the math game is better. I think it is going to be harder for him, which is good. He needs things to be a little bit harder.

Again, is it possible to put the games' questions:



to have more questions


to randomize the order




Because it always seems like the same order. And again, like we need either to be able to generate questions on the fly, or even click a button to say more questions and then it runs the AI thing. Or once you get to a certain point, it runs it in the background. He's obviously not gonna be answering the questions super fast. But I'm already noticing the same questions and he, again don't forget, 6-year-old's got nothing else going on so he's gonna memorize this sort of instantly
04:20 PM
Okay, the animal guessing - there's only like three questions. So there needs to be at least 20-30 questions. If not, LLM generated (like asking an AI to generate questions based on a prompt or something), but like we need more. It's totally not acceptable to have just a handful, but it's multiple choice. It's pretty simple. Again, he's six, but he's much smarter than this at least.
03:46 PM
And also stuff we, you know, deprecated. So, let's just really make sure this actually works. I tried a couple of the games, we're a lot closer, let's put it that way. I like this, like, learning about random animals, this is cool, the math games. Again, I can't see any of the icons so I have no idea, but you know he likes simple things, so that's fine. I like the way you help, so like this is good, but you know again this is actually got to be usable.
03:44 PM
Okay, one pretty basic thing: the actual chatbot doesn't work anymore. It used to work perfectly, so I'm not entirely sure what we improved. When I start the talk, it is like echoing pretty badly. I can't just click the button to stop it. I did stop it, but it didn't do anything.

Can we fix this? Again, the icons I can't see anything. Maybe it's because I'm in dark mode, but like I can see the icon, but not any of the words. Whatever is going on with the contrast or the coloring is a little bit too extreme. When I hover over them, I can see them, but I can't even read anything when I'm not hovered.

And again, the actual chat feature doesn't work. I'm a little frustrated because it seems like we're just going back to what I originally had with a little bit of engineering and then some of these games which is what I asked for originally. But we spent a ton of time building crazy stuff that's never getting used.
03:27 PM
Well, again, the game that we have at least the animal game is not multiple-choice which I've asked you to fix countless times. You can't see anything until you hover over it, like the icons are kind of all janky. It's not even clear how to answer. It's because the icons are just all messed up, so I guess I can see that the math game is multiple-choice. I don't know really how to go back. The animal guessing game is just wrong. Maybe we just get rid of that math game. When you answer a question it tells you "Got it right" or "Correct. Good job!" When I did that finally went through or asked the same question twice, I guess. But okay, that part's fine. I went to the puzzle game when I clicked on "Logic Puzzles" that did nothing. Again, I'm not even sure how to answer this. "Pick pattern puzzles" and "spatial reasoning". I have no idea even how to do this. Yeah, I know how to answer some of these puzzle questions, there's no place to answer them. Some of this is a little too rough around the edges for usage.
10:20 AM
Okay, as long as you have a plan, create the to-dos, and can keep track of everything, then let's get started.
10:16 AM
Again, I like the idea of games, and I want to have games, but it needs to be simpler if all these complex controls exist. Just behind something like anon that I can change and he doesn't have to change. The rest of this is big, I mean, like that's basically how I had it. Character which I didn't have, obviously talk and chat area, and then these features can sort of go somewhere like a little gear icon that I can mess with and he can mess with, as long as it doesn't really make anything break. I don't care if he messes with it because you can just refresh it and it'll come back. But I'm not saying like remove these features, I just want to make the actual product simpler.

If you can do that, then I want you to come up with a complex plan written into a markdown file that we can track and make sure is consistent. And then judge it against: "I am a smart precocious 6-year-old, would this new plan be fun and interesting and useful for me?" If it is, then go forward, and if it's not, make the changes.

Let me know a high-level version of the plan, which I think we have right now, so you should just be able to confirm or deny it. And then get started, but only after I've approved it and you've come up with a plan that you know judged it yourself, and then I've judged the final one. Simple, easy, fast - that's the focus here.
09:58 AM
Well, now that I finally see this, he's dramatically over-engineered this product. I don't know why we have quality and volume, it stopped recording 5 seconds in and didn't do anything. Sound controls I don't understand, I don't even understand what all these buttons are for (speech and local processing and quality and volume). It means that the stuff below it is cut off, I can't even scroll down. I'm on an M1 MacBook Air and I can't even see anything. The game doesn't make any sense. You know this is just totally over-engineered and insanely complicated. I kind of let you run wild and now I regret it a little bit. But what is the point of this now? And the game doesn't even have the multiple choice that I asked for. And it has fill-in-the-blank, which I said doesn't work on a tablet. Can you take a deep breath and come up with a plan to make this good? I'm sure it's great but I literally can't use this.
09:23 AM
Let's work on getting all these tests to either be not failing or make more sense or be more harmonized, and just sort of make sure that this is not an issue going forward.
09:19 AM
I still don't see anything being pushed here. Are you sure you pushed everything to `GitHub` main?
September 17, 2025
10:18 PM
Well, I don't want a 30-minute fix, so we should add the 57 ATP podcasts episodes. I don't know where you got that specific number, but okay, um, via that site immediately. I'm not sure what you mean about removing to-do comments, but okay. Yeah, let's do the prevention. I don't know what that means, but okay. If what you're saying is like there are to-dos, then we need to search the entire code for all the to-dos and do those all. But okay, if this is your you know, you can update your to-do list based on what I said, or just get going. I want to first make sure we have really truly detailed plans in both the Markdown file as well as our task list in Archon (a-r-c-h-o-n) so that another model can do this properly noted: what needs to get done, how it should be done (not the exact code, but like, this is what we're trying to do). Documentation's here, whatever context is required to do the text should be provided to the model so that it's not having to think, it's just having to do. Once we have that done, then I really want you to run a comprehensive plan to identify all the remaining to-dos in the code. However, the code was noted saying "to-do" which I guess meant "come back" or whatever. That's not really acceptable to me, so I want to go through the entire code and find what else is still waiting to be done.
10:12 PM
Can you create a detailed plan, write it to a Markdown file, and then create a to-do list based on that plan? That does it the way it should look like. For each podcast, there should be no sort of like unknown high-quality sources list that we can keep adding to if we ever need to. Let's say for whatever reason that a site just goes down or is dark or for whatever reason doesn't have that podcast. If we know that we can find podcasts somewhere else, we should look there, then do a Google search, then fall back on `YouTube`. Just like you said, then do an audio transcription, which is why I don't think we should have that many audio transcriptions. Can we create that plan? Make a to-do list, then you judge it against "Does this solve our problem?" Make edits to that and then show me the plan. This is when I want to provide my one and only user feedback. Then you make updates to that plan. Again write it to a Markdown file and use Archon to manage the tasks, and then you'll run autonomously without interaction. To complete the tasks with the final task being comprehensive testing. And then after comprehensive testing, I guess the true final task will be GitHub pushing and documentation really clear documentation updates to make sure that this is known and that the code makes sense.
10:12 PM
We have to try because the next train isn't for another two hours.
10:09 PM
But this means the fact that Accidental Tech Podcast is on your list means you didn't even do a cursory Google search because that is one that has a website with every transcript of every podcast. I think it's either the first or second Google search.

Can you review your process and figure out where this failed? What changes do we need to make to ensure that not specifically for the Accidental Tech Podcast, but that is one I know that we are checking Google, checking YouTube, reviewing the files, the links that come up in the first 10. If there's an exact match on YouTube, we can pull the transcription because again, there's a lot of transcripts that you should be able to get.

Some of these I know you can find. Like I find it hard to believe that nobody anywhere has This American Life transcripts on the internet. And you know, for what it's worth 99% invisible.
10:07 PM
So really every other podcast that I wanted to get had was able to be found except for Acquired. Or have we really found that hard to believe?
09:54 PM
So, like, what is Atlas doing now or what should it be doing? Is there anything for it to do past stage 100? Does 100 mean that every single `source_discovery` note article email is fully ingested in a Markdown file or something? Remind me what's and I made them, but like, what stage is 200, 300, 400? What's the rest of it after 100? Yeah, I'm like, what else is coming up? Make sure that the website works. It didn't work the last couple of times I checked. And then I gotta make my ingestions and start using it more like InstaPaper, but I just want to make sure it's actually working before I sort of get into my workflow.
09:50 PM
Okay let's push it to GitHub, update our documentation, make sure our documentation is ironclad, and then most importantly this should be running, right? How much have we processed? What's still in the backlog? etc.
September 16, 2025
10:15 PM
Also, I think we should add all of the modules or whatever to the task list. All of them.
10:14 PM
Are we done? I don't think we're done, are we?
10:01 PM
Yeah, I don't know where this needs to go, but I don't want to build something that's so brittle that specific words on a list break the user experience. He's six, but he does say stupid stuff, and I don't want something like talking about a shark or a type of shark or a type of bullet ant to hit a flag or a trigger flag. That's why I designed it to be working around you know sort of LLM calls with sort of you know kinda broad rules around what is or isn't appropriate for six-year-old. I'm sort of like okay with that level of ambiguity offline or anything like that that's fine but maybe I wasn't clear about that before.
09:48 PM
Okay, I'll just push to `GitHub`, and we're good for the night.
09:47 PM
Let's get going. My principles in general are fast, cheap, simple. As long as it runs fast, as long as it's cheap for me to have used (we're not using too much Wispr, we're not using too many LLM calls and we're using just lives on or sell them). The free plan I don't want to pay anything for this but it's only going to be used by 1-4 kids. So I'm not that worried about it. And yeah, the rest of this is ready to go.
09:45 PM
Anything left to do, or are we in a good spot?
09:44 PM
I mean, you can focus on whatever you know games I'm just saying, like the reading he does his own reading, the math we need to work on. If there's science facts or other things you know, since he's you know, he's kind of surprising. But the next tasks create atomic test next steps are the tasks great ordered by impact effort. Take my feedback, yep yep.
09:38 PM
Yeah, this needs to have really good documentation. Simple documentation but like for the technical stuff it should be really clearly detailed. I want all this. You should do it in whatever order you think makes sense. So the impact vs effort you should probably do that in the order that you have it here. But at the end of this I want the atomized tasks for every single thing with enough context that any agent should be able to do it. Plus I want to make sure that it is reviewed comprehensively after all the tasks are done. You sort of judge it based on its merits. Does it deliver a site that a 6-year-old could use for 30 minutes a day for weeks on end and would actually enjoy it? That's not the intent but like that's the vision. Enjoy it and learn something you know not that's better than watching TV right? So if it satisfies that after the judging then which it won't we have to make edits to satisfy that. Then I want you to give me a summary of the whole process: a summary of where you started which I see here so I don't really need that. A summary of your first pass, what the judgments were, and your second pass, and then I want you to update based on my feedback those atomic tasks that were judged for the second pass and then we start writing code. Is that clear? So first tell me that you understand and then give me the second, you know then the rest of this.
09:33 PM
Sorry, I was looking through this and I stopped at got. Sorry, I got lost. I'm good with the UX and the character companion. Again, I want to just make sure this doesn't get super slow. Parental Math Gate, he's way past that. It's going to have to be like, honestly, a question he just wouldn't know the answer to, like something really basic from before the year 2000. I don't know what it is, but it's something like that because he can read everything he can do the same kind of math that a dumb normal adult would do (two-digit number addition). I can't do two-digit number multiplication or division, so like, something more complicated than that but not sure what the point of it is. Just another fact. Yeah, I'm really liking the safety stuff. Again, just speed - I want this to be able to run quickly. If it makes sense to you. I dunno. Just like this needs to run quickly. I guess it's the only thing I can say. Yeah, I'm big on the no PII - this is for kids, should just be a fun ball and then go away and not save anything or have records or anything. I don't care. I don't want it. I mean offline is fine if it's easy let's do it. Not really sure what this 10-frame math game is, but he can do addition and subtraction of single digits fine. You can do double-digit math (low double-digit math) and if it sorts of chunks like time and coins, he can already do all that. But yeah, if we can somehow teach him 2nd and 3rd-grade math through this, great! He can already read at a 4th-grade level, so you know, I don't know what to say. Just reading stuff is like totally irrelevant for him, but if it can be done for you, I'm gonna let other people use us. So if it's easy let's do it, if it's not I don't care. The pattern is great, the pattern puzzles are fine with all that speech and audio sure great this is all fine network reliability ok whatever again I want to use you know I have to pay for the whisper and which you know costs I think a penny a minute so that's not the biggest cost but you know I do want to consider that and the AI cost should be minimal you know I'm paying a quarter a million tokens so I don't think this is gonna be using anything even close to that yeah gonna find with this sorry I'm on PWA performance accessibility fine it's not a problem yeah testing just needs to be tested living daylights so I really want super detailed tasks associated with all this all the context you know it seems like we have a really detailed plan I know I run a really detailed implementation plan that is you know the final implementation plan is reviewed I want the CI/CD github testing this is gonna stay in Vercel so it's got to work within the free Vercel I would imagine this should be fine
09:29 PM
So just while I'm reading through this, first of all, this is really
09:16 PM
Can you test the rest of the features? Just test everything and make sure it's all working. The entire app.
September 15, 2025
07:02 PM
Come up with just so many tests. I want more tests. I want to have tests on tops as tests. Then I need you to tell me how much has been processed or start processing everything.
04:56 PM
Okay, we're keeping all the data. It will be three times faster, that's great. We'll have a functioning mobile API. No fake AI claims, fantastic. Will be reliable, which is fantastic. Again, there's no marketing speak at all. It should just be the facts. I'm only one using this, so why would I want made-up claims or things that don't actually work? I've approved everything else from this point on unless you cannot based on the README, my mission, and vision, and all that stuff. Answer the question, and it's clear to you that it's critical, and you just cannot move forward. If you do not encounter that situation, I want to be you to finish. I want to be at the update documentation stage the next time I look back at this. When the code is tested and the documentation is updated, it should be running. The best way to prove that this works is for it to run for 1-2-4 hours. You need to come back and be like, "Yep, we ran everything, we did everything, it's running, we've processed 500, 5000, 5 million items whatever it is and it's running smoothly. We have YouTube videos, we have podcasts, we have articles, we have things pulled from the web, we have things pulled from something else, we've pulled a saved article. If you can prove all that's done, then we're good.

And the last thing is, keep running into these context shrinkages. Feels like we should be able to do this without the context getting so big and sort of compacting it as we go along, but I'll let you run it. I just want to make sure that this can run reliably. It's on bypass permissions, I want to be clear, I want you to run until you're done.
04:51 PM
Okay, I think we were supposed to do code reliability test and audit documentation vs reality after we tested the refactored system. So the next step should be designing the simplified architecture.
04:51 PM
Audio is silent.
04:43 PM
What are you talking about me making the baseline backup? I thought that was you. I don't understand what am I supposed to do. How do I make a backup? Is there something you gave me to make a backup? And if so, can't you just run it? I'm kind of confused. I thought you said you had everything. I think you were supposed to do that.
04:40 PM
Yeah, the iOS shortcuts - the overengineered stuff. Just let's get rid of that. That's good. You're the one who's going to start implementing the simplified architecture, right? I need everything to be done by you. You need to write all the code, you need to run it, you need to test it, you need to document it. Then you need to keep it running. So at this point, I've given you everything I need from you. At this point, you should be able to run without fail through every single one of these pieces of the tasks here and tell me when we're ready for the final product.
04:29 PM
Okay, the only thing I wanna make sure is that the mobile integrations we're talking about (not like saving articles from my phone, you mean like other things). Like I need to be able to, and that's something I haven't yet done yet because it hasn't been well designed yet, is like very easily and cleanly be able to send anything on my phone to Atlas from my phone. And the same thing theoretically from my Mac personal work or whatever from Chrome or a browser or something like that. I really wanna make sure that that works. So everything else I don't care about. The other things you're taking out - things that either don't work, fake endpoints, are too complicated, or are stub implementations. Even other things like exporting I don't care about that yet. I do wanna have a REST API or something that allows for something to access Atlas, but it just needs to be simple. Whatever is the simplest version of something that can query this as a REST API is what I want, not something super complicated. That's a case create the baseline backup task, you know update in Archon, ARCHON, all of the tasks that you mentioned here and get going.
04:24 PM
Let's go
04:19 PM
I mean again, I want to keep the if we already have complex knowledge graphs, semantic search, secretic questioning, patent protection claims. If that doesn't work and it just says it works but it doesn't do anything, then yeah, let's get rid of it. Let's keep the idea so that we don't lose it later on. To the extent you understand what I'm trying to do here, I wouldn't mind you creating a future roadmap to get me to that second brain. Again, it doesn't need to be super detailed, but if you can help me because we'll have the baseline, the simplified architecture, and then once we implement it, I want to know what to do next. When this is all done and tested, I do want to update documentation, fix the CI/CD smoke errors, and run comprehensive code reliability testing. The first three tasks really should go after update documentation, and then, like, a final version of update documentation would go at the end. We'd have basically the same to-do list just in a slightly different pattern with documentation being updated again. We should always be pushing things to `GitHub`, either local or remote, just so we have a keep track of what we're doing and we sort of Institute reliable PR process and stuff like that. But again, I think we're clear. What matters and the AI features to keep I agree with if it works and it's there, keep it even if we just commented it out. I just don't want to again because it doesn't really work perfectly or whatever. But I really want to get this ingestion pipeline storage on every article, email, podcast, and everything that I can give to you. There's a bunch of sort of like input steps I haven't done because I was trying to make this tested. If we can get to a point where I can just sort of throw at you a bunch of new inputs and you process them over time, then I'll find them and sort of we can eventually add those hooks into there.
04:15 PM
For now, I just want a digital filing cabinet. Eventually, I want a second brain, but that's not your job. Your job is to make sure that filing cabinet is perfectly stocked and clean. I want you to keep anything that works in the AI stuff and the stuff that is generic again. There's no claims here. This is not being sold to anybody. This is for me entirely. I'm not trying to bullshit anybody, including myself. There's no need to even if it is on `GitHub`; if somebody wants to take it, it's free. There's no business model behind this. I don't think there even could be. Don't worry about the content relationship right now; that's sort of beyond the scope of what I'm asking for you to do here. I do want it eventually to be the AI knowledge management system, but again, that's on top of the world's best filing cabinets.

So I want you just to be the world's best filing cabinet for what I want, how I want it. If you're 10 out of 10 and simplify the content, make it more reliable and user-friendly, then that's all I really care about. I don't really care about most of the AI features because I can always add those later. But again, I need the data. The data has to be there, 100 percent. The AI features I care about are if we're using AI to judge, "Is this article fully ingested?" Then that's what I care about. Using AI to provide summarization and tags is important, but it should be whatever exists. Like, that's all I care about. Everything past that, we can sort of shelf for now.

And I wanted to be really clear in the code and the README what's shelved, what kind of exists, what doesn't exist. And I'm basically not willing to pay anything for AI services to ask you a question. I'm trying to create this; I know I could probably have spent money on something that did some of this or most of this, but I wanted to spend the time to build what I wanted. I want to use the Google 2.5 flash light model as infrequently as possible, but if there is a way to make my life better, I want to use it. It's not that expensive; it's a quarter million tokens or something like that, so it's not a big deal.

Are we clear, like, before you do anything else? Make sure you and I are clear on what needs to get done. Before anything else, and you ask me more questions because I can answer the questions as you can see.
04:03 PM
Okay, I mean, before you actually write code, I want answers to my top 2 things:



What are the things you don't know yet?


What are the hard questions you need to answer?




You'll give me the answers to those questions, and then we can sort of decide what needs to be done. I really want to get to your confidence being 10/10. I don't really care about the 80% reduction. I want to be clear about that. I just want to make sure that what we create isn't a fraction of what a fraction of code for a fraction of features? I want to create as close to a 100% of features as possible.

We've designed some features that we don't need anymore or that are dumb at the end of the day. I want this to be really clear.

I read, listen to, and watch a lot of content. I really like consuming content. I'm not perfect at memorizing them, which is why I've created this Atlas System. What I really want this to be is my bespoke second brain that collects the information from all the places I consume.

I don't necessarily listen to every podcast, which is why I only told you to get certain podcasts a certain time. Some of them are historical, some of them going forward. But I listen to a lot of podcasts. I'm trying to read more but right now, for whatever I get and try to read and pay for and save. I want to have somewhere to put it all.

I watch a lot of `YouTube` videos about content, especially about AI, that I want to put into here so that I can remember when I'm like "oh that thing I was trying to do. What was it?" And I can just find it easily.

As long as that idea is here, it's like "is this going to solve for what Omar's vision is?" which I just sort of gave you in a really high-level overview. Then we're not delivering our goal. But I really want is all data that I'm consuming. When a `YouTube` video talks about the `github_repo`, you pull the `github_repo` even if you don't have it fully processed. I just want to have it there.

When I go to that thing like "oh, where's that thing?" I found the podcast, and then I go to a podcast and see "oh actually have 15 pieces of media from that podcast. The podcast itself, the metadata from the podcast, these 14 articles. And you know that's that's golden. That's what I'm trying to get done here.

How did this podcast, this `YouTube` video, this article, this newsletter from 6 months ago, and this idea from 4 years ago all connect to each other? That's what I'm trying to solve for here. But now it's just focused on getting all the information in one place in a simple way.

As long as we solve for that thing, because you're going to have to maintain this. I don't want to maintain complicated stuff. But also don't want you to be like "oh, well, I don't think this is important and you get rid of it." Like that's not you know, we might have been designed. It's not important, but if you're getting rid of it I want to make sure it's not important before it's gone.
03:55 PM
How confident are you that you'll be able to actually do this? Conceptually this sounds great. I really want everything to be like that's sort of why I came up with the 0 to 599 idea, and as we move things along the process, we only really need modules for each one of these steps. I mean, there's not literally 599 steps, but there's probably 50-60 different steps, and one module can probably do a lot of them, so we can create universal content processing and make this simpler so that we can parallelize and run the same thing 5 times. Great, then we only have to fix one thing, and we can create more clear documentation and processes workflows so that we can have a much simpler process.

So if you think you can do this, and then I don't care about the CI/CD failures. Let's create a baseline backup and let's audit documentation vs reality if we only need to. But if we're going to just change everything soon, in your basis for this is not based on the documentation but based on the literal reality, then let's just go all the way to designing the simple simplified architecture, judging the simplified architecture against our goals, ensuring that we're not like, I want you to have a diff basically, what are we losing, what are we gaining, what is maintaining the same? It's hard for me to believe we're going to have 80% code reduction and 0% feature reduction, so I want to basically have a list of the features that we're losing, and if I say I don't want to lose that, then we might need to modify the process a little bit.

Once I've approved, once you first designed, judged, made changes based on your judgment, then show it to me along with the features that were losing, and I approved or made any changes, then we implement into Archon. The simplification refactor as its own project, and then we can run the code to simplify and refactor the code, then we test the living daylights out of it. I want to test something that is sort of in a terminal stage, and the 5 you know, 500 stage or 598 or whatever is not a duplicated one, but like the final stage in both processes. I want to test a handful of them and make sure the same thing is happening, and then I'll feel better about this whole thing. Then we can update documentation. Then we can update all of our documentation, not just some of it, I want to clean up, I want to have a clean repository. This can be even a version 2 or whatever, I don't know, we don't really have that idea, but like this should be the basis of the final version of Atlas, so. This is really complicated, I want you to use Archon to keep track of things or keep to-do lists because there's a lot of work here. Make sure to write things down, not in the route, and in a temporary place where we can keep track of it, and then cross off the lists as we get to them and make changes to it, but don't keep this all in memory, write it down somewhere, and then once you incorporate all this, I think we're good.
03:47 PM
But can we do other sorts of comprehensive testing of the code to make sure it's reliable and not going to fail just as code? And then would they want to do a full review of documentation vs reality? Update either the documentation or reality, whichever one is wrong or insufficient.

I want to do a real push to GitHub, and then I want to do a real refactor. Is there a way that we can simplify this? Simplify, simplify, simplify. I don't want to lose any of the functionality though. So I want to find a way if we're doing something two, three, four, five, six, ten different ways. If we can find a way to do it one way. Find a way to make everything as generic as possible. Even if that requires more computing or even if it seems inefficient to you, a computer, if it's more efficient to me as a user of my time than I would rather do it. Especially things that don't require API calls like anything that or sorry that money costing API calls like AI. Even that's not particularly expensive but if there's any way to do something a hundred times programmatically and I never need to think about it vs me thinking about it one time. I would rather do it a hundred times programmatically.

So I want that to be part of this refactor. Is there a way to simplify this codebase? And then I want you to explain to me what that simplification is? I want you to explain to me why we should change from what it is to what it should be? I wanna make sure that we have a version of this saved as it is before the refactor. Then I wanna do the refactor.

Before we do the refactor, we need to write the code. I need to approve it, you need to validate it against our goals: "Is this going to make the process easier, more reliable, and more consistent? If so, then we'll implement it. Do that, run testing again, make sure we have no more CLI, CI, CD errors. And then you know, update the documentation, and sort of button this up so we're clear on what needs to get done. I know there's a lot there, but are you clear as to whether explaining what needs to get done? They're saying no, we're not going to fail unexpectedly due to some fallbacks, but I really wanna sort of button up this entire project.

There are other things I wanna do later on, but I really wanna get the ingestion, processing, and moving of data, saving of data, storing of data. If this is all text files, mostly, there should be a relatively small project. I'm talking about you know, a few to several gigabytes. We're not talking about saving tons of media files, tons of `YouTube` files. We're really just getting the transcripts, the metadata, the text files, maybe some images, but we're not getting anything big. So I really want to make sure this project is efficient and light and can run sort of forever without me thinking about it.
03:47 PM
Alright, can we do anything about these failures here?
03:27 PM
I'm going to ask you again. I want you to look at the entire process, start to finish, at least of this ingesting. This is really focused now just on ingestion, not on AI transformations or that stuff. We can always do that later, but on the AI ingestion portion. Taking articles, URLs, whatever you know, everything putting it into Atlas so that we have something to go with. What's the reason that tomorrow morning I'm going to wake up and you're going to say, "Oh no, I know we did all this hard work, but we missed this step" or "we did something now, has is there any reason to believe that that's going to happen? If so, why would it happen in theory? And then whatever theoretical reasons you can come up with, I want you to create a step-by-step process where you go and investigate each one of those separately. It's a separate process to investigate idea one, idea two, all the way down to idea n. Make sure none of that's going to happen. If it is going to happen, or we do have the same issues that you could have independently guessed just based on the project read me and whatever information you can figure out. When you figure out that there's a problem, fix it, and then do that again. This is a very detailed process, but I want to go through this process again and again until we can make sure that every single time we want to ingest something, it ingests correctly. I'm not saying it needs to be done, or even found—there's always things theoretically we can't find—but that you need to be able to prove to me for a specific article if you say at some point this article is not found, you need to show me. And there should be a log because we have a transaction log we created that intentionally there should be a log of where okay you gave me this url article.com didn't show up I went to you know internet archive and you know reason one, reason two, reason three it's not there either I went in um I did a google search it didn't show up there, or these are the things that showed up on the google search and none of them were the article, or all I was able to find is this 400-word stub and that's not sufficient for what this article is. And you should be able to prove to me that you've gone to the end of this process and you couldn't find it, or a podcast there's one podcast in specific where I know you're not going to find transcripts because it's two friends of mine, maybe 50-100 people listen to it. If somebody's transcribing that podcast and that service should be used for everything. I don't want to tell you who it is or what it is because I don't want to change anything. But I want you to prove to me that every single attempt has been made to transcribe that podcast and/or find the transcript of that podcast, and that's the only one that should ever be sent to the Mac mini. That should be something that we can do in relatively short order—my friends drop a podcast at midnight, let's say by 9am you should have been able to go through the process of that. That you know I'm guessing maybe not today we have so much backlog but in theory you should have been able to go through the process of checking okay nope it's on their website nope it's not on this place nope it's not there check YouTube it's not there check here it's not there yep it's nowhere. But like when that whole thing is figured out then we can say that I will be comfortable to wake up tomorrow morning and seek help. Continuous process until then I won't believe you. So figure this whole thing out and get going. Do the entire thing. I don't want to talk to you again until done.
02:53 PM
So you think this is going to work for everything? Like, is this something that we can use for all material? No matter what comes in, this is just like, "Hey, is there anything more we can do?" Right? Because that's really what this is. This is a bot or a script or code that just says, "Hey, are we done?" And the answer is just like, "Oh no, you could help me with this." Then it helps with that and moves it along. But you know what I really want is, and I think we can get most of the way there, for searches to do the work of processing podcasts and a systematized process that utilizes rate limiting and doesn't spam Google and doesn't do anything else. Can find all these transcripts, put them in one place, so that we can process them and ingest them into, and think about them later. So if you're sure that's what's going on, then let's put this into Archon for task creation, and then let me know when we're ready to actually run these.
02:50 PM
Yeah, I mean we're using Tailscale for all of this. It's maybe not clearly put in here. But I guess I mean, what can I actually do with this? I don't even mean what's the purpose of this code? It's great to have this code and now we have a better version of it. And I guess I kinda need to understand, am I just like running this code bank that you gave me up above somewhere once on any one of my machines? Like I run it on this MacBook Air and then because of whatever we already did before, it's going to copy to everything else and we're all going to be hunky-dory. Which again great but why did I do this again? What's the point of all this? I just don't really understand what I'm getting out of all this. Even though I did it so.
02:46 PM
Can you sort of go through the same process of figuring out what we need to do to create the work finder? I want this all to go through the same queue. If we have to parallelize the queue, that's fine. But I want everything to always be going through the same ingestion single point because we're not yet constrained and we're never going to be, especially now that we're doing all the backlog. But I want to figure out how to do the backlog and then the rest of the process should work the exact same. What's it going to take? What's the lightest lift we can apply to the code now to solve for this problem? I want you to come up with a detailed plan on what needs to be done. Then I want you to create that plan in writing and finally I want you to independently judge whether that solves my ask of the lightest lift in terms of the code? The most simple design as well as the most generalizable and flexible way of going about things so that we find these 349 Stratechery episodes and these Instapaper articles and all this other stuff. And just keep feeding it. At some point in the future we're going to start looking at whether we should be looking at now but I don't know if we have it yet, the URLs in articles and in podcasts but for now I just want to get it all ingested and then we can do that stuff later. Once you've judged it I want you to make modifications based on that judgment and then I want you to come back to me and summarize your revised plan. Once I approve it or provide any feedback then you go back to your revised plan, make any further changes, put it into ARCHON, and then we can start writing code. I don't want to be writing any code. I don't want to be doing anything tool-intensive until we've thought about the plan with all the information we currently have and come up with a solution. And then the code writing can happen after everything is in ARCHON and I want you to follow all the design rules about what to go there, how the tasks need to be atomic, and all that other stuff. So please follow exactly what I said and come back to me.
02:43 PM
How do we get the work into the queue? What am I misconceiving or how have we misdesigned this so that this isn't all considered work? Or like until something is not at the 999 stage, it's not done. And if there's time, it should be worked on. You know, in some sort of order. What's the orchestration there that is missing?
02:42 PM
What I'm really trying to do with this, and what I think I did, is be able to work on any machine from any machine at any time. I also am using my iPhone to do some work on my Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Virtual Machine. So I want you to create the final version of this because I'm just sort of copying and pasting from different things. We tweet things and I never made a final one. And I want you to tell me even though I did all this, what good is this? What am I getting out of this? Like, what's the value of this? I think I had a reason. But, you know, maybe I don't or maybe I was misguided. So I kinda want you to help me think through this.
02:38 PM
97 there's no records, no credit cards, no nothing to do. You're telling me every single podcast that I was looking for us to process, including every archived episode of Acquired and 100 episodes of Stratechery and all that stuff has been gone through every single ingestion process. Are you really telling me that every single article in that Insta Paper export CSV file has been ingested and every single one has been found? Is that what you're telling me?
September 14, 2025
11:37 PM
I'm not going to do this tonight. Just save where we're at in Cloud.md or somewhere. Let's finish our documentation about what's actual, push this to GitHub, and I want to go to bed. Do all this. Is there anything you need from me, or can I just assume you're going to finish this, and I can close the terminal and just go to sleep, knowing that it's all done?
11:34 PM
I mean, if there's a way for you to do it, I don't even understand what option 3 means. If I do it manually, you can be like, "Oh, that's how I do it, and I can do it that way." That's fine, if I just show you how to do it, I don't care about that.
11:32 PM
What are you talking about? The whole you said that the integration was done. I was asking you a question about my `youtube_history`, assuming the integration was done, and now it's not done. Which I get now. You're like being pissy at me about using Google Take Out. Your hint was to see if you could search through your index, but clearly you don't have an index. Could you lie to me? I'm confused about this now. So tell me what we need to do because you've been just making stuff up. You didn't even test this once you built a bunch of infrastructure on something that didn't work.
10:36 PM
I'm not running anything again. Everything needs to be run through the scheduler for Atlas and everything else. Just run this for one thing, just prove to me this actually works, and for anything, and then just feed everything you know feed this in right. This is what happens when we look for a podcast. At this point, we should have the number of podcasts we have, each podcast, the number of podcasts we're looking for. We have the transcripts (theoretically) just from the RSS feeds. We should have a ton of information about the URL of the file and the name of the file and all this other stuff. We should be able to look it up. We have all this data now, we should be able to figure it out, and there should be pretty quickly done. This is not huge, it's just it's not we're not trying to bite an elephant with one bite. We're just orchestrating a bunch of very specific tasks. We're at the end of a process again. If we go through this process, we should have a point where a certain podcast were just like "all right, just look it up in one place, two places, three places, four places" - if those normal places that we normally find it don't have it, just look it up on `YouTube`, look it up on Google, figure it out from there, and if it doesn't work, try again tomorrow. It doesn't need to run immediately, but this is how we want this to work, so let's make sure that's happening.

And then do the History Scraper, and let's start with you getting whatever authentication you need from me, and then we can figure everything else out. Let's figure out a big plan, and then I'll approve it, and you can go through it. We start with just approving my authorization, and then you can build the rest of it.
10:25 PM
Yeah, let's do what we talked about. Let's set up the history scraper. If I need to log in, tell me how to log in. I'm okay logging in once a month or once a year or once or whatever. If you can keep something alive by running it pretty frequently, the authentication should stay alive for a little bit. Let's do that. And then yeah let's use the `YouTube` API as a backup. It's like you know a backup of Google right? `YouTube` and Google are the same thing, and maybe this is something we should do before a Google search because if it's on `YouTube`, we can get the transcript from the podcast from there. Even if it's a messy file which it shouldn't be, we should be able to get it. And yeah I do want to integrate them both into our `NUMERIC_STAGES` system, but again this is more about these aren't necessarily a stage right? These are modules that can be used at different points at different stages theoretically. Tributes at one point in the stage. But do you get my differentiation between those two?
10:22 PM
The problem is the `YouTube` takeout doesn't let you run daily. I don't care about subscribers; it's not about who's watching—I don't have videos, so I don't care about that. So it seems like the only thing I need is the `youtube_history_scraper`. Why did I even get this `YouTube` API? Maybe I'm mistaken; maybe I don't understand what the point of it is. This was all about: I watch a lot of videos, I want to know if the video has a lot of content, we use you know AI to scrape the content (both what is actually said and all the URLs in the description, maybe even the comments) to sort of tease out information. But for now, it's just collecting information and then we can tease it out later. What lets me do this?

Separately, can I use this `YouTube` API to search for all the podcasts and use the transcript from `YouTube` if a podcast doesn't exist elsewhere? Because my a lot of times these podcasts are on their `YouTube` and you know again that's a sort of a brute force solution but it should work right? Let's think through this before you write anything.
09:21 PM
But again, aren't there when we say "something is not on the internet," we are searching Google, right? Like, we have a plan for all of this? Day walls and rate limits are all just like "do it later," "come back tomorrow" or an hour from now or whatever.
09:15 PM
Okay, well, so let's install this on my Mac Mini. Sure, whatever, I don't really quite understand what all this is. I'm fine with self-hosting it, I'm fine with having it use TailScale, I'll continue to use TailScale, I don't super really understand what Wes Term is. I want to make it unkillable. Great, I want you to suggest whatever you think is best. You have all my IPs, you have everything you need. If this is something I can use from oh, there's also my iPhone - maybe that's the biggest most complicated one. I also want to be able to use this on my iPhone if that is best served by you know, I continue to use the free version of Terminus, and you give me something to log into, but I want to be able to from any machine access any machines. Anything. I effectively want to be able to use, and this is why I'm saying like maybe what I'm saying is crazy or maybe you're like, yep, you got it, TailScale to let me from my phone access it for whatever reason a file right from my phone right a piece of code that can access a file from each one of those machines and it is just like seamless. Does that exist? And if so, tell me what it is. And then I'm not sure I really wanna understand what all this is, but like I want just you to tell me the answer, just fucking say it for me right?
09:13 PM
Ok, how many things have I processed in the last half hour, and what are the differences in statuses or whatever can you tell me?
09:11 PM
is there a way (this might be paid, so I understand that) where I can have a single piece of software that gives me terminal access to all my different devices? I have a Raspberry Pi, these are all on Tail Scale. Raspberry Pi, an Oracle VM, my personal MacBook Air M1, a work MacBook M1 MacBook Pro M1 14 inch. (That that really matters.) That I also do some development on and my Mac mini which is theoretically my server that should be on all the time.

And I want to be able to just work on the terminal and they're all connected together all the time once. I can just use this one thing as my terminal app for everything. Does this exist? Because this might just solve a lot of my problems. I hope it exists. It doesn't require subscription if it does. Like, what's just like, is there a thing that just like, yes this solves exactly what you're looking for but it's this much money, and just tell me what it is, and then what are my other options? Like, look this up on the internet, do a little bit of a search, but if this doesn't go unsolved then just tell me what the answer is.
09:10 PM
But I mean, the idea is for everything, from 0 to 599, not just the deduplication numbers. Like, do we have to just figure this out now and try to come up with our best idea of what it is? And if we're wrong, then we'll just have to change it later.
09:02 PM
And everything goes through the same process, right? Like we don't have 18 different processes. If I were to give you again the exact same ID CSV file with a different name, all the same URLs, you should be able to put it into a queue immediately and say, "This URL is this ID, this URL is this ID, and it came from this file which has an ID of something else, right?"

And then we say, "We do it in series, right? We do everything in series, so we just go through the entire first CSV and we'll have an answer at some point. And we should be able to at some point do a deduplication and say, "Like, every single thing you put in there was already in there, and the status of these are whatever and it's done, right? The status of that document that entire CSV that I put in a second time, that I had just already word, we're processing right now would all have a terminal status of like duplicative, right? Like 1.99 or I don't know whatever you decide what it is, but like it has that.

So I'm sort of wondering right now if we need to define the rough stages of these this numeric system in order for us to start being able to put things in a place and it be done, if that makes any sense, right? Like, if we have a status and if we have to later change a status, you'll say, "Like, we're changing now 199, we're breaking it up to 198 and 199. We should only care about is just things are currently 199 because in the future a new document is not going to know that there was ever a difference between 198 and 199, it's just going to see those two. Does that make sense? So like, I want to make sure this is already built in, if not, I need to make sure that what you're understanding what I'm asking because this is more conceptual than anything.
09:01 PM
OK, so now I'm going to ask the question I'm going to ask all the time. What have we done in the last hour?
08:55 PM
Sorry, I thought we were already doing option one. I didn't know what enum objects are. That was the whole point - it was just numbers, literally an integer that is, yeah, it's not even a big int, we're talking about an int. Are we good? I don't know why this is such a weird issue.
08:28 PM
Also, we're going to have to impact our content, so just make sure to remember whatever context we need and be ready to put this all in Archon, so that we have a way to track this and go through the same process we do for everything else of checking.
08:27 PM
Can we ingrain in our brain that this is where we answer and solve for all transactional information? We have like an Atlas database. When I ask questions about what's going on, when any internal service needs to know what's going on, it just goes to this one place and we just make sure that everything updates this all the time. Is there any way to make this freaking guaranteed?
08:22 PM
At the end of the day, it's just all you need to do to track progress is have a database file, a transactional file that establishes the ID flag. Whatever is the ID of a piece of content should be a number, not an alphameric. Let's make it simple. It should be like a number ID and you know ID1234 is in status whatever this number is 100 to 599 for now at time whatever the time that transaction happened. So we can from that single table say and then that table connects to the table of what's the name and where they come from and whatever but like from that single table we can say what was done in the last minute. What was done in the last day? What was done for this one project? How many steps did it take to 10 a hundred? And this one table can run all of our fucking metrics. So when I ask a question of like what did we do in the last day? It can run from this simple table.
08:19 PM
This is my whole point - we need to have a logical process that determines what's going on. If we think about these as numbers, where each hundred is one big step, each ten is one medium step, and each single one is literally moving. Sometimes you go from 1.0 to 2.0 because there's nothing else required in the 100 stage, but sometimes there's a 110, 120, 130 that's essentially what we're doing - we're just putting things in different places. At some point, when you get from 100 to 200, you've moved from "here's the link, here's the file" to "we got it". And then from 200 to 300 (I'm just making this up) it's like we've got it and we've judged that it's a full content - we think it's real, we think it's a real thing. And then whatever 3-4 we do some processing step to it, or 4-5 whatever something else. But like you get what I'm talking about.

So everything should just be set up in this stage, and then what we do in each one of these stages should be like one of these modules.
08:17 PM
Okay, but like don't most of these URLs already exist on our service? Shouldn't the first one be like "Hey, does this already exist?" and if it does, then like the ingestion skips what it needs to do unless we know that it already exists in a status that isn't high enough for us to say that like we got it off the internet, we got information that seems pretty reliable.
08:08 PM
There's a lot of people in the media and on the internet. Yeah, I agree. Let's do it. What are we doing?
07:53 PM
Because at some point, you know, we're going to have you know, fully ingested is the terminal status for a piece of content that is ingested. You know, fully ingested means we went to a URL or got a file or whatever we got something and we are pretty sure that it's what we think it is. Right, like, at the end of the day, that's all we know. We were told, "Hey, here's a URL, we went to the URL, there was an article from the New York Times. We summarize the article, it says the same thing that the description says or whatever you know, like it seems like it makes sense that's fine um versus we got an article, it seems like it's a big article but we got you know, 400 characters worth and some things are 400 characters worth but not you know, feature in the New York Times or New York Times magazine or something like that. So there's got to be some way to determine that but once we know we have that, we are at the terminal status. Now, there might be transformations which is turning it into from a whatever it is, whatever the piece of content is, however it is, into a markdown file and a html file and whatever else we do later, those are different statuses but that's terminal, you know, let's past ingestion and then that's processing and then we have sort of like, you know, the analyze or the you know, they quote-unquote AI part which is the tags and whatever other metadata we've collected um and you know, like moving the content along in whatever pathway um and then whatever like AI summaries we're doing, all of that is like further down the path. So like, you know, if you think about it from a number, from 1 to 10. 1 being the raw content, 10 being it's like done, we're never going to touch it again. You know, unless we do anything else, you know, we'll make changes or something or I don't maybe you never get to 10. um but 9 being like, we've done everything we're going to do, we're good, and 10 being just like that's the delta between 9 and 10 is just like whatever other feature updates we make where we would have to reprocess something. But does this whole thing kind of make sense?
07:02 PM
And while I have you left, note to mail carrier, please put un- Unlabeled- I don't know how to word this. Unlabeled, un-deliverable, generic- packages, well actually just envelopes or just you know whatever letters in side table. I'm basically trying to let the mailman know like hey sometimes it's just random mail and they just like leave it on the package table I want them to put it inside the cabinet. Um so yeah.
06:57 PM
The first sign is for the front door. There's a buzzer. There's instructions on how to buzz in which we're not going to be covering but this is about when you buzz in please say and I'm just gonna like speak and we're gonna clean this up later please say who you are why you're there and the name on the order or package or resident that you're looking for not just including the apartment number which is to say a lot of people call they buzz up and they say oh can you buzz me in but you know there's no video so I don't know who it is so this is gonna be needs to be an English Spanish and Korean let's make sure it's you know makes sense in those languages it doesn't need to be a literal translation it needs to say the same thing and then that's one sign and then but it's gonna be relatively small because it's gonna be kind of by the buzzer so we don't want it to be a ton of words so it doesn't always get a ton of light in that area so you just you know we need this to be efficient and then another sign that just says package table in all three languages and I'll just make that as big as possible and then in only English on that same one that says package table I wanted to say Actually, that's it
06:34 PM
Why did we even have a database that was 7.7 GB, and what can we do to have these restart loops go away?
06:34 PM
This is Evan.
04:19 PM
Oh, sorry. I think you misunderstood. I mean, I, the meta AI is to generate a proposal back to you, Claude. I'm basically saying that's how I was doing it. I want to have it automatically be done where you help me generate better responses back to you in such a way that you get what you want. If that makes any sense. It seems kind of dumb but it is helpful. You do not say the same thing when I respond in 20 words as when a chat GPT response is structured in its 500 words. So is that clear now? The change? I mean the rest of this is good. I want the code to be clean and I want everything to be straightforward. I want to update to Github. I want to push, update our documentation. But yeah
04:10 PM
And also, how do I actually use this? What's the use sort of like a user story? Do I just install it? Is this an MCP server? Like, what's the solution to this?
04:09 PM
But can we make some of these slash commands? I don't care if I have 50 slash commands or whatever, but I want slash commands. I want a "help me" slash command that explains this, and I really just want this to work sort of like automatically. Like I don't even know would I like ramble something and then I kind of want all this stuff in there. I want everything to be context-efficiency optimized, and I don't know, like I kind of want this to always happen. Maybe it's too hard or an ask.
04:08 PM
So do we have like a really simple idiot's user guide to how to actually use this now? Because again, I'm not running bins. I'm not running anything. I'm using this all via cloud code directly. So how exactly is that going to work?
03:55 PM
I don't know where this goes exactly in the workflow or the thought process or anything. But one thing I've done in the past is while working with ClaudeCode I get like some questions back and then I copy basically like some of the context and the questions. I paste it in just a totally different you know random unique new ChatGPT or Claude instance and ask it what would you answer? And it tells me the answer and then I give that as the answer back to ClaudeCode. And usually it's much better than how I structured it and it's much more efficient. Is that something we can sort of like integrate into here as well? I know I've talked about it in bits and pieces but I just want to make sure this isn't being lost or I didn't just imagine I said this.
01:47 PM
Yeah, this high-level understanding is correct about proceeding with the detailed plan. Yeah, you should. I mean, I really want to make sure I do like all three of the principles, right? Select, compress, isolate. This is exactly what I want to talk about. There was conflicting interest in whether or not to use subagents, but I do like this writing subagents for research. Single writing style file-based plans. That's exactly what I want to do. Yeah, I mean like I like all of this. I really want to come up with a super detailed plan. I want us to judge it again. I like us sort of judging ourselves. It's really important for me to keep doing that. And yeah, the auto-compacting is important as well because we're going to have to compact right after this, right after whatever I say here. But it's something I'm noticing is that the context is always getting 100% full and I just imagine it doesn't need to be. It really should always be much less full and then there's just less, you know, I don't know and you should be able to tell me this since you are a cloud code. How you do about caching and stuff like that. But doesn't seem like caching works super well. So the context management using file system and I'm not sure I had mentioned it somewhere but using you know sort of like an LLM agent just like instead of creating a database or an index just sort of referencing the literal relative locations of everything I think is really important and it should be in here as well. But I think this is all good. I mean I just want to make sure that I'm able to develop things in the future in a way that is comprehensive and simple and that this middleware helps and I think it is. So there's nothing else then yeah I mean the one thing multi-agent coordination. I do that's only on execution which is why I use our con but that is fine in general that's only like one thing is written and it's atomic. For what it's worth I also want to include if it hasn't been included making the tasks as atomic and providing the context in our con for each task so that it really could in theory a model could have a task erase context do the next task erase context and each task provides the source of the context or the literal context as required so that there is no integration between task 1 and 3 and so one can be run by one agent, two can be run by different agents, three can be run by a third agent and would be fine.
01:20 PM
the way i try to you know this is almost like I wish we could like sort of force through Claude code a specific you know way of doing things where first I give my ramble answer and then what you do is sort of like clean it up push me ask me back questions kind of like how GPT-GPT deep researcher no matter what you tell it it sort of asks you one set of clarifying questions And so many other words as I want to incorporate context engineering and offloading of context in a rational way. If this needs to or should utilize an MCP or if it can be done or should be done locally or whatever. But I want to make sure that we're utilizing context engineering in such a way as it minimizes our token usage. I mean, a big thing of OOS I'm really trying to and then it produces the research paper I kind of want to see if we can always ask the one set of clarifying questions so that we can you know kind of get to the result faster like get to you know usually when I ask for something or change or something there's probably more that could be done I know cursor or Klein or one of those ones as a thing where you can have it you know you sort of type in whatever you want and you have it cleaned it up I kind of want you know clean up as in make it better for do is find a way to use the fewest number of tokens so that the most amount of work can happen without a lot of token overhead, which this podcast made me realize is not a unique problem for me or any thing I'm trying to figure out. It's really something that everybody's trying to do. So you know, let's utilize what other people have done from all these links. You know, this is a big project. This is a very big project. I want you to research each and every one open each and every link. the models of the model hopefully will understand your request better and then you know it's that sort of middleware and what that's really what OOS is entirely right it's entirely middleware so I'm trying to figure out a way to like make the best middleware for me as possible so that I'm efficient as is possible on you know the front end I'm not gonna you know I'm not gonna change the way I do things I'm just gonna ramble or give small inferences examples or whatever but. You know summarize it figure out how this all this works together. You know, this is a very complicated large research project that I'm asking you to endeavor and all I'm asking you to do now is like figure out how to put all the context together again. A lot of this is like if you can, you know, systematically or programmatically, you know go to each and every link open the file copy it save it somewhere and then you know I want this OS middleware to you know sort of save me from myself save the project from itself always make sure that it's pushing to GitHub and you know like even if at the end of you know every command it says you'll make sure to push to get hub make sure to document like all the stuff I try to remember every time if I just say like yep do that that makes sense and then at the end it adds on and you know make sure to document a github or whatever you know I'm talking about like you understand consistency. like if you tell me it's too much, I can find another way to. To do this if you just sort of save all the information in one place and then say like okay this is too complicated for me but I have all the stuff. You know cleaned and mark down files or text files or whatever, then I can get a different model to parse through it, but I think you can do it. I know you can do it so I really want to, you know, again. The way I try to. You know this is almost like I wish we could like sort of force through Claude code a specific, you know, way of doing things were first, I give my ramble answer and then what you do is sort of like clean it up, push me ask me back questions kind of account GPT-GPT deep research are no matter what you tell it it sort of asks you one set of clarifying questions. That's what I'm talking about here. So what I really want back is first an understanding that you're following what I'm asking. I don't need a detailed plan just like yep, I get it conceptually here's the high level. Then what I want back and this is what I want all the time like again this is like a learning or an idea it's like first I want you to confirm that you understand what I'm saying. Come back to me and if it's complicated if it's simple just do it right? And then say like okay this is what I did. And then it produces the research paper. I kinda want to see if we can always ask the one set of clarifying question so that we can kind of get to the result faster. Get to usually when I ask for something or change or something. There's probably more that could be done. I know cursor or Klein are one of those ones as a thing where you can have it. You sort of type in whatever you want and you have it clean it up. I kinda want clean up as in make it better Are we good kind of thing? But if it's complicated say like okay, I understand what you're asking me to do. It's this at a high level are we on the same page? And if I'm not then I can stop you and we didn't go through a ton of time and tokens and effort on the wrong path. But if we're if I'm good, it's like yep, I'm good. Then what I want you to do is come up with a detailed plan again. This is all planning. This would really we should spend like 10 times as much time planning as doing but you do a really detailed plan and then you judge against my input of what I told you. Does this satisfy what I was asked to do? And if the answer is no then make the changes to get there and that could be one time or 10 times but like at the end of the day I'm always trying to look for the easiest simplest cheapest solution So as long as we can do that and it solves for the model so the model hopefully will understand your request better and you know it's that sort of middleware. That's really what OOS is entirely right? It's entirely middleware so I'm trying to figure out a way to like make the best middleware for me as possible so that I'm efficient as possible on the front end. I'm not going to change the way I do things I'm just going to ramble or give small examples or whatever but what I'm looking for that's great and then after I provide you know after you judged a couple times or judge once or whatever it is you give me I have a detailed plan but here's the high-level summary are we good? And if I say yes then you put the detailed summary detailed plan into Archon then you confirm to me okay this is what I put in there are we good again? I say yes and then you run them. I want this OOS middleware to you know sort of save me from myself, save the project from itself. Always make sure that it's pushing to GitHub and you know like even if at the end of you know every command it says make sure to push to GitHub, make sure to document like all the stuff I try to remember every time if I just say like yep do that that makes sense and then at the end it adds on and you know make sure to document in GitHub or whatever you know what I'm talking about like you understand consistency. What I'm talking about here so what I really want back is first an understanding that you're following what I'm asking. I don't need a detailed plan just like yep I get it conceptually here's the high level. Then what I want back and this is what I want all the time like again this is like a learning or an idea it's like first I want you to confirm that you understand what I'm saying come back to me and if it's complicated if it's simple just you know do it right and then say like okay this is right are we good kind of thing but if it's complicated say like okay I understand what you're asking me to do it's this at a high level are we on the same page and if I'm not then I can stop you and we didn't go through a ton of time and tokens and effort on the wrong path but if we're if I'm good it's like yep I'm good then what I want you to do is come up with a detailed plan again this is all planning this is what really we should spend like 10 times as much time planning as doing but you know we do a really detailed plan and then you judge against my you know input of what I told you does this satisfy what I was asked to do and if the answer is no then you know make the changes to get there and that could be one time or 10 times but like at the end of the day I'm always trying to look for the easiest simplest cheapest solution so as long as we can do that you know and it solves what I'm looking for that's great and then after I provide you know after you've judged a couple times or judge once or whatever it is you give me I have a detailed plan but here's the high-level summary are we good and if I say yes then you put the detailed summer detailed plan into our con then you confirm to me okay this is what I put in there are we good again I say yes and then you run them.

03:06 PM
I kinda want that last step that we just said. The 9th task that I was talking about. Check for everything. Is there any way to add this? It's just like this is the final step for everything. If the answer is no, then we gotta restart again. It's compute time. I don't care about compute time. My time is valuable.
03:05 PM
But can we add this? This is the 9th task here, for the entire Atlas, not just this specific project. We're just adding another task. I just want to keep adding things to Archon, and even if it takes a little while to get it developed, I just want to make sure that we don't lose track of it. So tell me that that's the case. If that's so, then let's just again do one pass of all the tasks against a simple question: Is this going to make Atlas a reliable ingestion process 24/7/365 without fail? And if this helps us towards that path, or at least if not just actually the end result is that path, then I want to figure out a way to make sure that this works towards that because I'm getting kind of frustrated. I want to move on to other stuff, but I really want this to work.
03:03 PM
And I know I didn't sort of talk about this for this specific project, but is there any way we'll ever get to a place where I can come one day and the next day it actually ran the entire 24 hours and didn't say "oh sorry, we failed" or "this broke"? Is there anything I can do, or is this just the reality of software development that I'm going to have to deal with until I figure out a more comprehensive way to refactor this or figure out a different monitoring system?
03:00 PM
Okay, I'm trusting you again. I feel like we've talked about this a bunch of times, so let's get it all put into Archon. Let's project manage this and make sure we have everything well thought through and implemented in order to find this stuff.
02:57 PM
Going forward, there's no more "I couldn't find it", it's failed. If it fails, it's got to be Google searched. If you're telling me that something I found (a normal person) has got something that is not on Google, then I find it really hard to believe you. That's what I'm basically saying here. So everything should be found, everything should be processed. There are some things that are just too good. There's no way to access the information on the open web, and I'm totally fine with that. Those should be the ones I deal with separately.
02:50 PM
But are we clear on what I'm trying to do? I want this Google search to basically generate you know either the direct link where a dead link or an email newsletter is and then that link gets put into Atlas and it's entirely ingested. The whole point of the Google search is to find options so that we can satisfy the criteria of an input was put into Atlas, we found the article, process the article, and we can say we've satisfied that it's a clear what we're trying to do globally. This is specific is one big source of inputs; this is the paper thing because I have a bunch of other ones I want to reprocess (all my emails and newsletters and stuff like that). The whole point of it is to say, yep this input was satisfied by this other input which we've processed with this output.
02:45 PM
The daily limit - let's just run everything at whatever the free daily limit is, or if we have to sign up for an API key, we get a slightly higher daily limit. Again, it's not about everything has to be done. It just has to be going through a process. We figure out what it's going to take to not have any placeholders for anything, and that this actually all works.
02:24 PM
Otherwise, if it's not an uploaded article, I want to fully ingest it again. Nothing is ever finished until it is either fully ingested or we've run it through every single process as many times as we think is reasonable to say, "Nope, this is truly a dead link," or it comes back as a dead link and we did a Google search of it and we searched archive.org and everything else, and it's not there. Then that's a dead link. But if we haven't done everything that could possibly be done to find it, then we should not find it.

The last thing is everything that's an email should be able to connect it to some of the inputted materials that we had because that was a lot of the emails. I want to see if we can figure out which ones are missing and fully implement all of these articles.

So now that you have this ip.csv, each one of these is a URL. You should process each URL separately, keeping track of everything as normal.

What I first want you to do is tell me that you understand what we're talking about with a very short summary.

Then I want to say, "Okay, I understand that you understand what we're talking about."

Then I want you to produce for me an extremely detailed plan that you'll put into our Conarchon and go through everything you need to do to implement this: all the changes you would need to make to the code to make this work, every single thing that you would need to do to basically say, "Yep, we're on the same page. I know exactly what we need to do," and at the end of this plan, it will be fully delivered and processed, and all the content will be processed, and like the entire Atlas system will be resolved.

Then I want that plan, and then I want you to judge that plan against it. It's the person who has been disgruntledly building this application for the last two months going to say that this solves the problem that he is trying to solve. If the answer is no, you need to go back to your detailed plan and make the changes.

After you've made your changes, I want you to show to me both in Cloud Code and in our Conarchon the detailed plan. I want to review it. I want you to show me the detailed plan, and then I want you to summarize the back-and-forth: your summary of your original plan, your summary of your judgment, your summary of the changes that you made, and the summary of the current code.

Then I'm going to approve it, and only then do we write any code at all that actually impacts the codebase. This is a planning stage, a judging stage, a planning stage, a judging stage, a planning stage, a judging stage, and so on and so forth until we get to the execution stage.
01:46 PM
Well, one change is 2025 has been an interesting and eventful one for me, not for her. And that I hope for both of us 2025 is a little bit less eventful. And yeah, the rest of this is more or less fine.
01:42 PM
Okay, I want to kind of think through this letter that I want to write to Ashley. It's a happy birthday letter, obviously, but I wouldn't think about what I was going to write until I wrote it. This is it:

Happy birthday, Ashley! I finally found the cards, and as I said, I wouldn't think about what I was going to write until I wrote it.

You've had such a good birthday week so far, and I'm looking forward to bowling etc. You've had a very interesting and eventful 2025, and I'm not sure I could have imagined that on September 10th I would have met somebody who is interesting and outgoing and smart and beautiful as you. I'm not sure. I hope the rest of 2025 is not quite as eventful, but if I have to go on activity somewhere, I hope I can do it with you?
01:40 PM
Are you finally working now?
01:39 PM
The transcription was dismissed.
01:36 PM
Your transcription was interrupted. But Flow can still retry it for you.
01:36 PM
The transcription was dismissed.
01:36 PM
The transcription was dismissed.
September 7, 2025
10:21 PM
To be clear, I'm not just talking about the Mac Mini part. I'm talking about this whole thing - the whole "for remaining items" they're not all Mac Mini. Are they? If they are, that's fine, I don't really care, but I thought only one of them is.
10:19 PM
Okay, so remaining completion. Yeah, fine, yep, let's do two. Mac mini integration again. We have a 16 GB Mac mini. You can do whatever a 16 GB M4 Mac mini can do; just assume it's going to work. Make it as simple as possible. It's only going to do what it's told; it doesn't think other than to run. However, it should run. But it only does heavy lifting; it doesn't think at all. So that should require very little testing, right? Yeah, I feel like at one point we even said we had like 5,200 podcasts that we had identified individual podcast episodes that we wanted to capture, but maybe that was just a made-up number. And then yeah, let's see the rest.
10:02 PM
Just a couple of things I'm remembering or thinking about:



In addition to us getting the transcripts from this podcast, ideally we should get the non-advertising links from the podcast. If they provide them as hyperlinks, we should pull that content and evaluate it (if it's just something garbage, doesn't matter, but if it's like sort of content and even also metadata for this podcast). If it's there, we should take it. I'm not saying create a whole process around it if it's wherever we get it, we should take it, but I know it exists a lot of the time.


Some of these changes for the entire podcast maybe you know Atlas database right, you understand that this is not just like only a podcast specific thing but yeah like the sequel light architecture I think we need to just implement that sort of across the board when we're running into issues because it's just going to save our butts.


Internet archive should be like part of the something now I'm remembering something totally random and I understand but like the atlas.khamel.com dashboard has like a url ingestion link and sometimes it has like site blocked just take it in just say like we got it and then process it, don't tell me if the site is blocked, doesn't really matter, as long as it can be processed, say it's processed, don't block it at the ingestion point, that's the whole antithesis of what we're trying to do here, just collect the information and then deal with it, never turn it down, never go away.


Everything like I'm just looking at simple monitor anything just be simply monitored, like this should just be run very simply, the whole project should be simple.


 The other thing I want to say is I want to make sure that all the individual tasks can be run by essentially any agentic AI, so like actually here


09:48 PM
Phase Rollout is fine. Again, I'm not worried about any of these suggested improvements. Phase Rollout, sure, we should. I'd rather just, yeah, sure. Cost control I commented before, that's what the Mac Mini's for. I'm concerned about the MVP first because I feel like it creates a situation in which we create bespoke solutions as opposed to finding slightly more time-consuming computationally but less time-consuming programmatically and less time-consuming to maintain systems that are more generic—just searching Google for every single thing. Even if it's inelegant, if it gives you in that first 10 links or 20 links the answer that you're looking for, it just solves the entire thing. Sometimes, there's more elegant ways to do it, but at the end, we should always go to what's the way if somebody was asked somebody else with how you would do it, you just say "let me Google that for you," and that's basically what we should be doing.

I'm fine with community integration that's part of the research. And then yeah, I think I talked about the rest of that. I just want to make sure that again this is all connected to the total project; it's not its own discrete, you know, crazy system. But yeah, let's just do this.
09:43 PM
For 1.2.3, I wanna be clear that I really don't want to spend any money. Or if I do, I want it to be very de minimis - in total, $5/month across APIs and everything else. Right now, I'm at even with all the testing, I haven't even hit $5 this month, so it'll never get this high. This is also doing all the backlog like multiple times, so I just want to be clear about I'm not really willing to spend a bunch of money. That's why I have this Mac Mini integration which I haven't actually set up yet but will be done once we sort of figure the rest of this out. It should just be assumed because I can just run it.

For phase II, infrastructure foundation, initially, I thought it was better to have a no-DB architecture or something, and it would just be fine, but it seems like we were not able to manage that with LLMs. Yeah, to manage that, so we need to go to more like SQLite databases or something really simple so that we can keep track of everything. That's maybe just a more high-level compliment. I mean, the background worker I'm talking about phase IV now, it should be with everything else, the entire system atlas should just run kind of all the time slowly. And I don't mean literally all the time. I just mean like not every several hours, everything should be running every 30 minutes at the most? Because most of the stuff should never have to do anything. All this processing should happen now and then running it should be sort of relatively trivial - each one of these things at most is going to take 30 seconds to actually run through, and most of the time it will never have to happen, so I think 30 minutes at the most, and ideally every couple minutes just so we're just like getting it all done right away as opposed to waiting. And if there's a backlog, it's fine, but just like run everything all the time, just that's it.

One thing, now I'm looking at the pros and cons, I'm just looking at the cons: complex, not worried about it; cost, I already kind of complemented that before; time, not worried about it; dependencies, not really worried about it as long as you know the only sort of fundamental dependencies are on like stuff like OpenRouter and a couple other things. But even if like one thing fails, we should be able to just sort of keep falling back. And maybe even like I want to add in literally the last step is the podcast name and the podcast episode plus transcript in Google, and searching for it as well.
09:36 PM
Let's come up with a comprehensive spec of this:



Think through what we need to accomplish and how we want to accomplish it


Do this in a very methodical manner


Plot out every task and subtask


Make a to-do list


Connect it to ARCHON


Project manage it as a project


Before we write a single line of code, I want this whole thing figured out


Unless you have questions, what needs to be done?


I want to review it


I want you to actually first do it in detail, like do the entire thing based on what you know right now


Then summarize it for me


At that point, I want to provide feedback to say if that summary is good or not


I want you to also judge pros and cons and what changes should be made to improve it


Review that, then I'll approve it, and you'll update the subtasks based on that


Integrate it with ARCHON


Confirm to me that everything works


That's the entire pipeline




I agree with what's left. Need to be final. Every single podcast, even podcasts that have stopped running, and I just said I want archives like Radiolab which I think has stopped running. I just want the archives, but I also want the files. These are all different things. I want this to all be figured out. I feel like there are centralized sources of podcasts we found them before, and they somehow have disappeared into the ether of podcast transcripts for various reasons, sometimes for ads or whatever. I don't care how they don't need to be super accurate. The more accurate the better, obviously, but I feel like we need to just have a list of all of those and we check them all every time it's just a simple search against a single source, many of which probably have APIs which we can work with. Let's figure this out. This should be automated at all times. I'd rather go super slow 24/7 than try to slam things through every once in a while. Can you do this, and then let's do what I asked.
03:13 PM
Spent so long on this that I'm gonna hit my token limit. So let's get to a stopping point. Update our documentation. Update our push to GitHub remote. And update our Claude.md, agents.md, quinn.md, and gemini.md with our current status.
03:09 PM
Remember we talked about no more prioritized_updated.csv or whatever? Shouldn't this all be in the podcast database? Delete these podcast files. All these random podcast files need to go away.
03:08 PM
You better not fucking talk to me about 35 podcasts again. Where are you coming up with this information? Where? You have to tell me.
03:05 PM
Don't you ever tell me anything about prioritizedpodcast.csv. There should be nothing about podcasts that is not in the podcast database ever again.
03:01 PM
Okay, do this now for every podcast that I care about in any way. There should be more than 37. I'm really, there's no way I'm gonna double check now, but there's no way it's just 35, 37. For every podcast, I said I want some kind of information from either historical or going forward. Please just figure this out. Stop coming up with new systems. Just solve the problem. You get it?
02:59 PM
Can you summarize what the hell is going on here as it relates to these transcripts? How is this so hard? If it's really this hard, you need to tell me, and we need to stop trying things that just don't work. I really think it's not this hard. I really think I could do this in an hour. I feel like I spent 10 hours trying to give you a way to systematize it thinking this would solve the problem but it hasn't.

So what is the complicating factor here that we have not provided you or explained to you? If you finally figured it out now, what was the insight?
02:57 PM
What are you even telling me? What database are we looking at if they don't have podcasts? I don't even understand how this is possible now.
02:50 PM
Man, this was just to give you some ideas. I'm not saying copy them exactly, just figure this out man.
02:49 PM
Then what is the point of this project? These things can happen within the project, and there's no prevention of them happening in the future.
02:49 PM
Specifically an `api_key` that matters. Some API keys are like, everybody has the same one. But I just want to make sure that this actually works.
02:48 PM
Do we at least have a process now that no matter what happens we're not going to be pushing anything to GitHub that has an `api_key`? Can you at least tell me that?
02:45 PM
How did this still actually happen? This whole project was created kind of to avoid this happening at all, and somehow it still was happening.
02:44 PM
Just look for all the podcasts. If all you do at the end of this is say "I have a database file with every podcast episode we care about and where I think the URLs are, but I didn't download any of them," that would be fantastic. But you can't do that, even you can't even go podcast by podcast and tell me, "Yep, I found a good source of this or a bad source of this via a Google search, and literally the first result is often the answer."
02:43 PM
Again, I know you're obsessed with these 4-5 podcasts. What about the rest of them? Why am I consistently arguing with you?
02:42 PM
Are we sure that we're not going to be exposing our API keys somewhere? It keeps happening.
02:40 PM
I just really don't understand why this isn't so simple: you find a location, you find all the URLs, and then all you're doing later is downloading them. And what you're telling me is I found every transcript and I just haven't downloaded them because of rate limits or whatever. That's fine.
02:39 PM
But you get why what you just said doesn't make any sense and why this needs to be fixed, right?
02:31 PM
Well, Hard Fork! Remember I have a New York Times admin/login, Stratechery I have a login. I don't know why you're only focused on these handful of podcasts because I don't really understand why we can't figure this out. You're telling me that if I look right now on just if I Google Lex Fridman first of all you spelled Friedman wrong, podcast I'm not going to find any transcripts. I don't believe it, so I'm going to actually do that right now. I'm just going to pick one at random.
02:30 PM
I don't really care how fast things work. I care that stuff is actually accurate. So are you telling me that it's working now, and that if I check in an hour it should find 10 more, and 24 hours it should find 100 more? Or is this gonna work for a minute and only work for this one This American Life episode and never do anything else again, which is what has been happening for weeks?
02:13 PM
Okay, like you told me what is going on here and I believe that this will all work. Can you kind of explain this all to me? Again, I use almost exclusively Macs, I use almost exclusively iOS. I'm right now using some combination of Terminus (free) and I also have Web SSH (free), but I can only use one at a time. And I have that logging into my RPI. Does what I have work with this? And can you just kind of explain to me what's going on here more than just the architecture? I need a little bit more explanation.
02:09 PM
Maybe this is a good time to sort of figure out. Right now, I'm using an Oracle OCI VM to do a lot of my development because I like having one place I can log into (terminal-wise), it's always on and always working. Before I was using my RPI (Raspberry Pi), and it would usually work and sometimes not. But I am finding that this terminal only doesn't really work with a lot of these tools. A lot of them sort of presuppose I have a UI or am using something, even if not cursor, using something, you know, even just VSCode which I don't really like to use. I really like to do everything out of the terminal, but it would be nice sometimes to be able to edit files simpler and just have a UI element.

So my question is, what's the best way to do this? I have a Raspberry Pi. I have a Mac mini which is more than capable enough. The problem being that my Mac mini sometimes just doesn't connect. I just can't easily terminal into it for a variety of reasons which I can figure out now. So I'm just trying to figure out, what is my solution to this problem? Like, what should I be actually doing? Again, I have a Raspberry Pi V4, 8 gigs. I have a Mac mini and then I have a bunch of like, you know, Mac laptops that I use. Mac mini and the RPI are always on. Obviously the Oracle VM is always on, but I wanna be able to, the problem I have right now with Oracle VM and I hate using Tmux (which I know is probably the real solution to this), but I log in disconnects because I'm on my phone or something or on my computer and I forget. And then I don't have the exact same session there. I know I can just retype everything in and resume, but like, you know, I kinda want the best of all worlds. I want what I have with Tmux, but I don't wanna have to, I don't know. I don't know the real problem I'm trying to solve for here, but I just want something consistent. I mean, I know I should really be doing it on the Mac mini and doing other things but there's got to be a better way to do it.
01:29 PM
This project is literally all about not hardcoding secrets. Let's make sure we're not doing that, right?
September 6, 2025
11:45 PM
I'm not going to do that. Just update claude.md, agents.md, gemini.md, and GitHub with whatever your problem is. I'm just going to deal with this tomorrow.
11:44 PM
All right, let's just do everything we can do without the `mac_mini`. Let's just wrap up. Let's update GitHub, update documentation, update Gemini MD, update Claude MD, update Agents MD. You know, update everything, and just I gotta go to bed.
11:38 PM
Nope, I want you to do what makes the most sense. Let's just get this figured out.
11:36 PM
Yes
11:36 PM
If you say so, then let's just get moving. I don't understand what we're doing. It seems like you understand exactly what we're like, very clear, but nothing's actually getting processed. So, what's the constraint between where we are right now and a super detailed plan on how to finish this project and then doing it?
11:33 PM
Just get rid of whatever the podcast that doesn't work with this list. Let's get moving. Everything you say here is fine. These are only worried that we don't have this sort of thought out in terms of any rational way. If you just think about a podcast, it's a piece of information. It's a piece of information that sometimes has value, and some of this stuff has value in the future for everybody, which is why I know there are podcasts, transcriptions that exist. I figured this out, have done it, and sometimes I want just a podcast transcript. Sometimes I want it just the most recent one going forward because it's just like something where I don't care about the history. I just want the thing going forward. So from that perspective, does the way we've designed this make sense? Because I'm worried it doesn't.
11:32 PM
Okay, it's fine, I agree. How many podcasts are there, and how many do we want archived? Not "how many we want archived only", as in we don't want any future podcasts, but we do want all the historical podcasts or some number of historical podcasts. Give it to me in descending order of what I put there, and then I'll know that we're clean.
11:29 PM
But can we integrate this CSV with all these prioritization lists and other lists of podcasts? I thought this whole thing existed, which is why I'm like, "Why is this so confusing?" Can we just integrate this all together? If we need to do some figuring out because, like I said, stuff like ACQ. I said I wanted a thousand podcasts. I was specifically there's not even a thousand podcasts. It exists. But I wanted to make sure that that information perpetuated through the system. And it seems like it's all gotten lost and jumbled and reconfigured. So I want to figure that out first now.
11:28 PM
Okay, bro. Just do it. I don't understand.
11:26 PM
Yeah, just do stuff man. Just rock and roll.
11:26 PM
Can we make like a database file of this somehow? So we don't keep running into this problem and you being like, "oh my god, there's so many" or what blahblahblah. Like you know it's not that much. Talking about 200-300 rows in a database with like 10 fields max.
11:25 PM
Can you find the OPML file? That's where it's going to have it.
11:25 PM
Can you?
11:23 PM
I thought, "Oh my God, what the hell were we talking about?" I thought you found it. You were like, "Oh, I found it." Feel like nothing's being saved, such as the sessions and stuff like this happens. We lose everything.
11:17 PM
Are you kidding me? You have this. Don't we have a podcast database? This is the whole point, this is why I'm so confused about how this even is working.
11:02 PM
I'm running out of tokens, so can you just give me the most detailed version you can give me of this entire plan in one shot? And then push to `GitHub`, document. That's it. That's what I want. But the next thing I get back from you should be every single thing that you could possibly say in one command with the remaining tokens that I have so that I can execute on it tomorrow morning.
10:55 PM
Before I got my mojo working? Yeah, I mean, obviously I want this to fix properly. Oh yeah, one more question. Just let's do whatever needs to be done, in whatever order makes sense. First, let's make the biggest question and planning session first, and then build the rest of the code. Like, let's spend the time and tokens up front to actually think and solve for something in the end, as opposed to doing this piecemeal, which is killing my patience and time and tokens. I think you understand my frustration at what we're doing vs. what I think we're doing.
10:54 PM
But also push to `GitHub`, obviously.
10:53 PM
I kinda don't really get. It never seems to actually be running. We keep talking about how it's always running, and everything's running fine, and then it's just like "oh shoot, we forgot about this" or "we didn't do the podcast" because whatever, we forgot to run the schedule or define the tasks. Like, everything's being written but nothing actually runs. So it's hard for me to believe this. I feel like the number of 684 podcasts has been showing up, and it's like 665 of them are the ATP podcast which is fine, but like I have there should be thousands of them there, all you know from different people at different times, and it's not running, so I don't really get what is going on.
10:49 PM
Something's not quite right. Cool, um, so what is going on then? We got this done but like what's going on with the project? Let's eventually push this to `GitHub` and whatever but like what's up?
10:42 PM
Like doesn't something like this already exist? Didn't we, I feel like I've, we've talked about developing this five times. So why does it keep getting lost or complicated or whatever? And I don't wanna like create ten different monitoring services, only create one monitoring service that works with the other ones but like I don't wanna have to interact with anything more than one.
10:41 PM
I want you to do the potential next actions then. I really kind of want to get this running to see what- I mean the whole point is not actually to start it as needed. Why don't we just- fine. Then like let's just check that nothing is needed to be done every 30 seconds. Like it doesn't need to be running forever. I don't need some enterprise-grade service. I just want to make sure that if something is needed to be done it's just being done. We don't just have just things holding forever and everything is simple enough so that nothing should really ever break to the point where it can't be resolved if you get what I mean.
10:35 PM
I don't understand secure execution wrapper. I don't understand what you're asking for in question one. And then for question two, what do you think? Where should I design? I'd rather skate to where the puck is going as opposed to do this again. What makes the most sense? I don't understand really now we're getting to the edges of my actual understanding. I know conceptually what you mean, but I don't know the difference between what's good and bad. I'm trusting your judgment.
10:34 PM
Can you explain what you did? I don't mean in a task way. I mean in terms of methodology, thought process, and philosophy because I'm trying to implement this into the way that I'm developing a personal operating system, and I want to get the thought process of turning this into a production-ready, fully tested, and `GitHub`-committed project. Does that make sense?
10:30 PM
The other thing I want to make sure is that without fail, every project I work on in Cloud Code, Gemini, or Quinn exposes my `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`. It's just a matter of time, if not when. Is there any way to avoid this happening that we can add into this project? It's always so complicated and it creates so many issues. It just always becomes easier to give it one key because there are always keys and different test environments, and this and that, and so on and so forth. It becomes impossible for key management to be maintained. And then at some point they get dumped into a log, and oh there we go, sorry, do it again. Like this has got to be solved. This has got to be a solved problem. How do we solve this? Yeah, the 1Password is the one complicating factor, but it really should just be like we install the project in any way, and then 1Password just immediately gives you like, "Hey, this is how you log in, the link, and that's at the beginning." If you can't get past that, then you don't spend a ton of time working with it to realize it doesn't work at the last step. You either fix it at the beginning or you just give up, which is fine. It's better than doing something wrong. But yeah, I know that's random, but I just want to make sure that's implemented. Again, it's really just like the user experience of this and how to just be in a project and be like, "Oh shit, I should just include oos, and how to tell Claude code or Gemini CLI or whatever to just go get this. Implement it in this way. What's the integration to an existing project? I feel like that part isn't super clear and it's usually figureoutable, but again, it uses a ton of tokens and time. And effort which is the whole antithesis of this.

And then another thing which I don't know if I have anywhere, but I really want to just minimize token usage as much as possible, be as efficient as possible, which is why spec makes sense because when you get to the implementation part, you're not just like searching. You're searching for information randomly. You have sort of like clearer information.

And then another thing I think that at which I want to solve for which again I know I'm providing vague information which is the whole point but is it feels like every project is always searching through the file system and it takes a bunch of time and it creates a bunch of weird issues as opposed to having some sort of like index or database or something searching just like a thing that is updated and has more information than just like the file names. It has like some searchable information, useful information for an LLM. I want that incorporated as well. So I know I'm giving you a bunch of information, so like you're going to have to ask me some questions, but I want to provide you this.
10:25 PM
How can you independently create a judging parameter to judge if this project makes sense within its own parameters? Like, some idiot is just like "Hey, I want a way to securely keep my environmental variable and one password which I already pay for, and just have this whole thing set up so I can just kind of fuck with Gemini and Cloud Code and Quinn and all that other stuff. But I don't really know how any of this stuff works, and I want to do it for free forever on Oracle OCI VM. It basically has to all work with a remote VPS service, but it has the benefit of effectively 24/7 connectivity and has a public IP, and it can be set up with Caddy DNS or Caddy SSL certificates, so it can be an HTTPS site and all that other stuff. So there's pros and cons, but that's it. They're like "I just want to provide you an OpenRouter API key, and otherwise, and then you know, basically, and also I have a Mac Mini or a Mac, whatever some Mac computer that can run high processing tasks if I want to, and if not, that stuff just won't exist. I don't even know if that's related to this project I see that, but whatever. And that's it. To be able to figure out on your own from the project, it has it doesn't work for that idiot, so what's it going to take to get that figured out and tested, and this this passes that test, that's what I'm looking for. So can you just first tell me what you need from or just give me the high-level version of it, then create a really detailed task list, and then start implementing the tasks.
10:23 PM
Can we make sure everything's been tested internally? Like, test the code? Is there not some service? I know there's Linter and Rough. First of all, that should be done. But like, is there not some MCP or some standard way to just test code to make sure it actually does what it says it does? There's got to be.
10:22 PM
Do you not have access to the internet? Can you not look up the URL I gave you for Phase 2? And you're explaining how you would think about doing it as opposed to what you're going to do.
10:21 PM
Has everything been written to GitHub? You're basically telling me my two main projects are done, so let's make sure they are.
10:19 PM
I feel like the way you're describing this thing, I just gave you `SpecKit`, and what I think it is or isn't. Something seems weird about how you're talking about it and how I'm talking about it. So it says nothing to do with websites or anything; it's really about spec-driven development. I don't even know it's written in Python and shell. I don't even know what we're talking about, so I'm worried you're just making this up. Do you have access to the Internet? I assumed you did, so that's why I'm a little confused. Basically, tell me what the name of the project is. It has a very specific name, you have to install a certain thing. Until you can tell me that, I'm not sure what you're talking about. So, before I want to answer the rest of this, one seems right, like phase one seems right; it's just phase two I don't really understand what you're talking about.
10:16 PM
I give you the code. Just go to that main GitHub and figure it all out from there. The process of SpecKit is likely going to take over, and it's a good idea. It's connected to this BMAD system and this AgentOS and all this other stuff I'm trying to integrate together. That's really all it is. For 3 and 4 together, what I really think is… I like Archon, and actually, I haven't even started using a lot of the other stuff, but I like the project management until I get into all the other stuff that it has. So I want to continue using that, but I want to incorporate as much as I can the SpecKit, and I don't really know what that means, which is why I want you to kind of figure it out for me. And then you, the CLI, should be able to use any agent with OOS. It shouldn't matter which agent I use, so there should be multi-agent by design.
10:13 PM
I was using Archon to develop some code, and I think it's fine the way it does it for cloud code, or maybe I'm using a ton more tokens. But I feel like I want to, and I don't know exactly where this goes. This is why this is a little bit more free-flowing. I want to figure out a way to stop this from happening again. I like using Archon; it's nice to see it visually, but I just saw something about Github releasing Spec Kit from Github, and I want to use that as well. So I'm trying to figure out how to sort of combine all these things because the Spec Kit from Github is backed by Github, so it's going to have a ton of value, but I want to sort of do both.

What I'm going to give you now is what I asked you in a different project to describe how we can improve the tasks, so I'm going to give it to you, and I want to sort of talk through and figure out first, what questions you have for me, so I can answer them. Then, you can tell me, "Here's the plan": I ask you one set of questions, you give me one set of answers, and from that, I can develop a plan to integrate all this. I want you to first describe to me, high-level, what the plan is; I approve it, and then you write all the code and check the code or test it or whatever. It's sort of like the whole point of this Spec Kit and this whole project. But I just want to make this actual project better as well. So here we go.
10:08 PM
Do you think you could accomplish the tasks in this project? I'm not asking you to do anything. I'm saying based on your abilities, based on what you know you can do, based on the code that is there, do you think you could accomplish that?
09:20 PM
update everything to Claude.md. I'm gonna come back. I'm frustrated, and this is not moving forward. Unless you can actually get these tasks done because you can access Archon and know what the tasks are, and you can get moving.
09:16 PM
No, I can see it says `mcp_server` ready. I can see everything's working. Figure it out. And then once you figure it out, stop fucking asking me again. Write exactly what you did into Cloud MD so this doesn't happen again. Do you understand?
09:16 PM
I can see you tried to access it because I saw the log showing you did. So what is actually going on?
09:15 PM
You wrote tasks to it last session. I don't understand how you're not able to connect to it now.
09:13 PM
These are the tasks in Archon that I needed to get done. Are you telling me these are done, or other tasks are done? It's really hard when you're not using my to-do list for me to know what the hell is going on.
09:09 PM
I need to emphasize that I need you to be using Archon.
09:07 PM
Okay, maybe I didn't say it correctly. Please interface with Archon.
09:06 PM
Are you actually using Archon? I don't see the task moving over to in progress.
09:04 PM
We should have two sets of tasks:



One focused on something called Podemos


Another on my general development




Let's start working through all the general development tasks first.
September 3, 2025
10:33 AM
We literally just created this authentication with a new ENV using one password. I'm really confused how you're telling me this thing I just set up isn't working. Are you telling me that this one password authentication thing doesn't work at all?
10:32 AM
Again, just use a process to prove I want to see the charges on approving this actually works at all.
10:31 AM
The last charge I see was you used 2.5 flashes on August 27th at 9:30 in the morning.
10:30 AM
And that's what you're telling me is the Mistral model is being used somehow for free without going through my `OpenRouter` activity.
10:30 AM
To be clear, I'm okay with the cheapest model, I just don't see any models being used.
10:28 AM
I still haven't seen a single charge on my `OpenRouter` activity for anything on OMA 3.1 instruct or flash or anything. I haven't seen a single API charge, and I imagine I would need a ton of them for this project. What's exactly going on?
September 2, 2025
10:26 PM
Okay, well maybe the API keys weren't working, so I just went into my environment, my private key, updated the API keys for OpenRouter. Now I know for sure that they work or that they're real. Let's just run all this again to make sure everything actually works.
10:22 PM
Let's fix any of our minor issues. Let's really just make sure everything works 100 percent, everything's running in Atlas. I really want to get this thing just humming.
10:20 PM
The transcription was dismissed.
10:18 PM
Just to be clear, this is all real, this is working, and tested. Everything here is 100% like this. Some moron (which is me, the person developing this) went to some company's `GitHub` page and it just lets you use one password and a file you create there on your own separately in this format to use this operating system which integrates Archon and 1Password and Claude and Quen and Gemini and all the stuff that specifically works for me. Nothing private is being exposed; this is all working right.
10:16 PM
I'm not wrong though. The whole point of this project is that there is no private information ever in the code. So there should be no reason this couldn't be public other than this being a genius idea which I'm 100% sure it's not right?
10:15 PM
I'm confused why we have this example.com in there. What part of this isn't something we can run right now? I don't understand why this is like fake information and not real information.
10:12 PM
I know, I probably should know this, but how is ~oos/run.py on some random person's computer supposed to do anything? They go into their existing project, they do what? I don't understand. Maybe this is me. I'm not super sophisticated in Linux.
10:09 PM
Uuuuumm well no let's fix everything. Just like make sure this thing is running. If it was broken we didn't realise it. Just let's fix it and let's make sure everything works.
10:08 PM
Ok, let's just build it. Let's finish this. Let's do this whole thing right now. What are you waiting for? It seems like we are agreeing.
10:06 PM
Okay, is there anything more for Atlas on this project that we need to do now, or is everything else just working fine, and it's ingesting and everything's running in the background. If that's the case, if we're all done, I don't care about developing this other thing. I just want to make sure we're done with this project and everything is working.

Now we have real API keys. I was actually wondering now that I mentioned it, how it was doing any AI stuff. If what you're telling me is it didn't actually have API keys, so like, what has been processed, what needs to be processed, um, like, kind of what's going on there. I'm actually glad that I remembered that.
10:05 PM
Got a look at this and basically figure out what I did, what happened, how this is working, how this is failing. Everything like that and fix it and create all the different iterations and just sort of solve this given this issue.
09:55 PM
No, right now I'm in the Atlas project, so I want to first make sure Atlas works. Then, separately, I want a very detailed critique of the `oos_integration` system and ways it could be improved using this project as a test case. But not again using the exact code or worrying about any of that - just objective information. I really want to make sure Atlas is using this and my environmental keys are secure, and we're logging it in all through one password. I'm just going to have one place to do this from now on. So I want to make sure that's running, and then everything else should just run automatically. I don't want to manually run any of these things as long as we get the benefit of the environmental thing, that's the most important. And then you know, all this other stuff later. But it should just all be in Atlas working fine, and then separately the OOS is you following.
09:30 PM
It should just be integrated into the functionality of Atlas how it runs all the time. I just want to make sure we got it. We got authenticated on this machine, don't we? Let's figure out what we got to do to make this work so that I can have it connected to my 1Password and all that other stuff, and it runs it tests. I want to get all that done, you know?
September 1, 2025
10:36 PM
bismillah.
12:02 PM
I'm still getting the backend service startup failure. Please fix this. You said you fixed it, and it's not.
11:57 AM
I don't care about fixing the `GitHub`. I care about working my Archon and Archon.CAML to work, and when I go right now it just gives me an error of "Fail to Load Settings", so it's still not working. Can we focus on making this work for me and less worried about the `GitHub`?
August 31, 2025
11:25 PM
Can you help me? I thought Archon's whole point was it had a very cool front-end, and all that other stuff, and you keep talking about pressing buttons and Swagger. That does not seem like what I thought I was using. I thought it was like a dashboard. Can you tell me what I'm missing between what you're showing me and what I'm imagining I'm going to be using?
11:24 PM
I thought there was going to be a whole UI; that was the whole reason I created this Archon thing, not to get APIs but to use their frontend that's going to help me manage all this. So I'm kind of confused about what I'm doing.
11:23 PM
I literally don't even know how to use this. Or just go to archon.khamel.com/docs every time to use it?
10:47 PM
Let's push this to `GitHub`. Let's make sure this is clearly documented. And then we'll stop for the night.
10:33 PM
Can we also add the information into agents.md? Again, agents.md and CloudMD should be as similar as reasonable. I want to add this idea of making a unique random port into dev.md for our projects so that we don't run into all these issues with everything at 0.8000.
10:26 PM
Let's update the documentation, review our code, make sure everything makes sense, and push to Github.
10:05 PM
Yes, I want you to be automatically reprocessing problematic content. Let's build the actual reprocessing pipeline and run all 956 through it. I thought we had this already, so I'm really confused.
10:04 PM
So are we reprocessing now all the content that needs attention actively, or are you waiting for me to say something?
09:56 PM
Can we please stop just evaluating content purely on the number of characters? We should be able to actually look at the quality of the actual content itself and evaluate it and then provide an evaluation score as part of the process of ingesting it, not something we have to be doing now. I don't understand how this is the first time we've thought about this.
09:53 PM
You need like an evaluator that looks at the final product, and evaluates it, and says: "Given what I think I know either about a podcast or an article, or whatever. Is this article complete? Because this transcript would fail immediately."

Let's again, think through this comprehensively and come up with a overall plan of what needs to be done: how we are going to execute it, how we are going to add the actual code, how we are going to update documentation, how we are going to push the GitHub. All that stuff needs to be thought through.
09:50 PM
So now that I'm actually able to read the articles, it would be great if there was a button to reprocess I have this article right here, then I'm going to give you the error for. But anything that we see stuff like that we should fix this, this is not sort of the point of this device is to just have random stub articles like this.
09:47 PM
Also, I have a ton of errors in my GitHub. Run failed here, run failed there. Can we look into what's going on there? It's yeah, tons of run failed.
09:42 PM
If I wanted to click on something, I can't actually see the articles and the proactive Socratic recall patterns. I can click on it, I can say in proactive that I reviewed it, but I can't actually review anything, which is not really super useful on mobile or anything else. The pattern detection really understands what's going on here, even when I browse the content in the Browse section. I can only delete or tag archive it, I can't read it. I can't do anything with it.

And then finally for the transcripts of the podcast, it's structured really poorly, just as transcript and the name of the podcast. It shows like an unknown flag, like just a metadata here is not great. And so that's just on the Cognitive AI when I go to the system dashboard, it really sends me somewhere kind of useless. I'm not really sure what to do with the scheduled jobs (not to say there isn't something useful), but I don't know a job name or cron string. I don't know who or what would ever use that, but didn't seem super useful for me.

We talked about the mobile dashboard which is connected to the cognitive amplification dashboard. Fully understand what value is supposed to get from that? Having access to the APIs I guess is useful, but again, I'm not super confident that this is what makes sense.
09:41 PM
You do know that even
August 28, 2025
10:14 PM
Also, it's been forever since anything was pushed to Github.
10:13 PM
And also this dashboard. Is there a better one than the one I'm looking at here at api/v1/dashboard? This is not giving me any real information, and now it's gone, so I'm assuming you're changing it.
10:13 PM
You know, a bunch of the stuff doesn't exist at all, right? I mean, I see that I finally have a real dashboard, but a lot of this is just either gibberish or pointing to nothing.
10:01 PM
To be clear, the original file is everything, and what we save as the Markdown file or whatever is this cleaned-up one. We're not messing with the original file or anything and we're just improving it. Why is anything failing on the enhancement process? I'm just curious. And the rest is still running, that's fine.

I'd appreciate if you could provide me a little bit more detail on how to unblock whatever on Oracle OCI security group. I'm not super familiar with this.
09:38 PM
Let's for anything that was truncated at 10,000 characters, let's make sure we re-load this. We're going to have to basically reprocess or re-ingest everything, possibly at this point, but we should have it all, right? We should have all the files and all the URLs of everything that we've processed. And you know, at this point, if we don't need to, we don't need to rerun it. And if we know it's a duplicate, we don't need to reprocess it. We should theoretically be able to process everything.

Again, I'm not worried about these things going quickly. As long as it happens, it can happen extremely slowly. I don't care if you process one article a minute. If I know that at the end of the amount of time that given articles that it works, it's fine. But it needs to actually work every time. That's the problem we're having.
09:35 PM
Okay, I'm not seeing anything. It's just not resolving anything when I go to that URL that you gave me for VPS access. I'm not sure exactly what's going on, but shouldn't there also be easily 2000 articles in the overall database? I'm now worried that things got lost in translation or transition.

And what more cleaning should we do? And I'm not entirely sure why we have a 10,000 character limit. I didn't ask you to do that, but let's re-run this. Anything that was cut at 10,000, I want to be processed again because there are large articles and stuff like that.

What can we do to remove navigation ads, social buttons, filter email letter formatting? Look on GitHub, there's probably standard ways to do this. I really want to make sure that we actually have a lot of these articles, and if we don't have them in the database, I want to get back to that.
09:32 PM
I have a question. Theoretically, we're taking the whole article from the web, right? If we're taking the entire article from the web, are we getting the ads? Are we getting the images? What are we getting in addition to the text? And then what are we doing to make the text more readable? To the extent that it's a lot of text on the page, how are we identifying what's the actual text so it doesn't say "print and share to Twitter" and stuff like that in there? I'm just sort of thinking about this now. And so I want answers from what's actually being done in the code.
09:22 PM
It's ready to ship, but we can't even process our own backlog.
09:16 PM
Well, if this is true then I want you to finish the backlog of all my stuff. I have tons of podcasts - again, just the transcripts don't download anything. Tons of podcasts that I know have transcripts somewhere on the web. If you come back there's probably 10 podcasts that won't have transcripts somewhere. I imagine some of them are going to be paywalled stuff I have access to but may or may not have the transcripts, and those I might generate myself. A few very small ones like ones about friends of mine. But everything else I imagine you should be able to find somewhere somehow. So if you come back and tell me that you didn't find it and we didn't finish processing all the articles and.htm files and everything else, then there's no way I can believe that this is done.

So now that we finished developing, I want to run this - it's done now. Let's run and test the code that we've developed with our own data. Let's dog food our product and get to the point where we've tested everything with real stuff and we know what works at least as well as anything can.
08:52 PM
featuring the two characters
August 27, 2025
10:33 PM
With this project, which phase are we in? What are we fixing? What's going on? We're running into a loop, so I want to make sure we're making sense. Let me know what's going on now.
10:33 PM
Where are we?
09:27 PM
It's up with this documentation. There's no even simple way to tell somebody how to use an Apple product to send files, links, anything, anywhere. Like what the hell is this? I thought we had fixed, there's like hundreds of files in the root directory. They can't all need to be here. Like the way that this is the structure of this is just a total mess. What is going on? Like I don't really understand how I don't just have a file called quickstart.md that just tells me exactly how to use this as a user. What is even going on here? I'm really confused what kind of documentation we said we were going to have.
08:57 PM
Well then let's fix those. Let's fix the tasks that need to be fixed and also add in the idea that we need to have testing, validation, documentation, GitHub, all of that stuff. Please make these tasks bulletproof so that a dumber model can actually do that, and then include all the context that is necessary in order for it to do each task, so it's not spending tons of tokens looking for information that we can just tell it where to find.
07:28 PM
Exit
07:14 PM
This should never happen again. Add this to the dev.md file and let's figure out what's going on and stop this before it ever happens again.
07:11 PM
Again, I can't emphasize this enough. Make sure this stops happening. Spend all the time you need to check Context 7 MCP and look things up online. Really spend the time it takes to make this work.
07:08 PM
Let's also resolve this memory leak and endless processes. This is all I want to work on now. I want to build a super reliable, consistent way to make sure this doesn't happen. You need to figure this out, spending all the time and tokens and resources required to resolve this once and for all. Do dozens, hundreds, thousands of tests if that's what it takes.
07:06 PM
So we don't have atlas-venv issues later.
August 26, 2025
10:10 PM
What's the simplest solution to this? I want to have for a khaki I have stuff, but like, what do I buy to get me 80% of those solutions there with 20% of the cost and effort? I was mentioning olive oil and oil and salt because I just always have them, but I'm not saying I should necessarily use them all
10:10 PM
But I guess I'm just trying to figure things out as I go, learning from every mistake and celebrating every small victory along the way.
10:07 PM
I was using Gemini, and then it happened again in Quinn. Are you sure? It's just happening. I mean, they're both on the same CLI, so.
10:03 PM
So just like anything that says plain roasted seaweed or whatever is the cheapest per unit I should buy? Or is there one I should be looking for?
10:02 PM
Yeah, what's the cheapest option if I'm really just looking for something to satisfy my oral fixation? I don't need them to taste amazing, I just don't want them to taste bad. I'm not gonna spray anything on them. If you tell me, "If you just spritz them with canola oil and salt, which I always have around, then I'll do that." That's basically as far as I'm gonna go. So what's the simple solution to this?
09:59 PM
Yes, just figure it out, please.
09:58 PM
How can we fix this? I'm just looking for a solution to this. I want to keep moving on with my process, but this keeps happening. I don't know what to do.
09:56 PM
Do you think you can figure out what's going on in this log that I'm going to paste?
09:50 PM
Can you take a look at what the hell is going on here and try to figure out how we keep crashing this machine?
09:48 PM
Okay, I think you need to look at what has happened because the same exact thing has happened twice. When you try to create a table, the whole memory crashes. Let's figure out what's going on there now. You have all the knowledge in the world of how computers work. You should know what these errors are causing.

Let's first figure out what the hell is going on in this Oracle OCI VM but this.
09:47 PM
I'm trying it for the first time now. Having it look up these seaweed snacks I want to buy from a local Korean market
09:46 PM
Obviously, I don't know what the hell happened. Let's not do it again and let's keep moving towards the goal.
09:44 PM
I live on the corner of 4th and Norton in Los Angeles, 90020. There's a California market pretty close by. The reason I'm asking you specifically is I just finally, at 42 years old, discovered the organic roasted teriyaki seaweed snacks from Trader Joe's. But I don't need a million little packages. Each one of these is presumably 30 calories. I want to get a bigger size, but I want to go to the California market and get whatever makes the most sense. What's the best deal? What's the best idea? What's the best sort of version of this teriyaki snack that I can get? Ideally you can look it up at the California market or alternatively a similar Korean market would normally have these features.
09:42 PM
Resume. I don't know why you stopped.
09:39 PM
And tell me how successfully you think you can accomplish the instructions provided there.
09:37 PM
I'm running out of tokens, so goodnight!
09:36 PM

Osteophage 7 in the right order, in the right process, so that we just have a single file to follow. That's it. You have all the information you need, just get us to the finish line in one go.
09:31 PM
We all got to live our best lives, right?
09:30 PM
I thought we had phases 3 and 4 and then ones after that. I'm not sure what you know is missing and what we need to do, but I feel like I want those to get figured out. Again, what I mean about front-end and back-end is not literal front-end and back-end. I mean like ingestion and analysis and the database and space and all that other stuff. So let's incorporate all that.

Not only for the rights, but for the European Junior Championship.
09:30 PM
09:29 PM
Okay, I want to do let's just continue our development or enhancements. I want to get to a point where the backend is clean and clear, the frontend is clean and clear, and everything makes sense.
09:27 PM
Okay, what were we doing before we went on this tangent about disk space?
09:27 PM
I want to add it to both of those as well, again, like what we need to be doing to do this right and not have this happen again.
09:27 PM
Dev.md and agents.md
09:26 PM
Did you add it to my dev.md file? I know you made another file, but did you do what I asked you to do?
09:25 PM
Because once we figure out what is going on, I want to add the learnings into the dev.md file.
09:25 PM
Why were we ever generating this much garbage? What's the cause of this?
09:24 PM
Like, is there even developmental benefit in studying what went right and wrong in some of these log files, or is this again just total garbage? And like, everything we would learn from there we could learn from a Google search.
09:23 PM
Yeah, I'm leaning into this weird hobby/obsession thing
09:22 PM
Like, you know, error logs, JSON, podcast ingest - what you know? Is it just delete or is it minimize? The first two error logs and podcasts are gigabytes - I care about those. The other ones (anything under 10-50 MB) I'm not worried about. But I just want to get rid of the giant things and if they're giant, we don't need them - let's just summarize them. And if there's really just nothing to summarize and this is just all information that we could just otherwise throw away, that's fine. Again, I'm not really too worried about Github. I'd be interested in why we have the same environments, so if we can rationalize that let's do it. But yeah, let's just rationalize whatever makes the most sense.
09:21 PM
Is there nothing to be saved from some of these log files?
09:20 PM
Like, I just don't understand how data takes 7.7 gigs. I'm okay with output. I'm okay with backups. Again, 10 gigabytes of other is not really telling me anything. I don't know what we could possibly need in there. And I want to keep all the development stuff. Don't worry about that. But, like, let's find a way that rationalizes the stuff in Atlas.
09:16 PM
Well, I also want to know - what is taking up this even 70% (70 GB worth of data)? What is actually on the network or the storage?
09:15 PM
You know what caused the topspin
09:15 PM
We're certified to work the airspace out of the 63. Theoretically, we demand it to keep operations
09:15 PM
I am just working on my weird AI app.

Well-timed with his wife's movies and their weddings. Some people are just a championship away from a fairy tale
09:05 PM
Okay, let's create a pathway from getting from our 60% complete. Previously we were saying we were 90% complete or whatever. But I don't know what the hell happens. Let's figure out a way to get from where we are now to where we need to get. I don't know what the heck happens in this database. I even asked questions about how it got from 300 megabytes to 20 kilobytes. And I was given an answer, but okay, let's figure this out.
09:04 PM
How are we doing? I think we were done with phase III and maybe phase IV, or is it just phase III?
08:43 PM
Audio is silent.
08:43 PM
How can I use you for meetings? What if I'm having a meeting? Can I turn this on and just it works with that?
08:41 PM
Is your name Tobias?

Hello, are you recording what I'm saying?
