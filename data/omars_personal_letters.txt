3/25/25 (In Counseling)
I want to take full responsibility for my actions and the patterns that led to them. I recognize now that last Tuesday wasn't an isolated incident but the culmination of problems I've created in our relationship:
Speaking in a way that left little room for your perspective and interrupting you during discussions
Using my physical presence and tone in an imposing way, especially during disagreements
Dismissing your emotions or concerns as less important than practical considerations
Becoming defensive when you raised concerns instead of truly listening to understand your experience

I understand these behaviors have made you feel diminished, unheard, and unsafe. I was wrong, and I am truly sorry. I recognize this fear is completely reasonable given what happened.I understand your biggest concern is how you can know I won't cross that physical boundary again, and while I can't prove this with words alone, I'm committed to demonstrating it through consistent actions.

I realize now we've been stuck in a negative cycle—what Sue Johnson calls the 'Protest Polka.' I've pushed harder and harder; you've needed to pull away for safety. I'm truly sorry for my part in that dynamic. I realize now that my fear of losing our connection led me to react in ways that actually damaged it.
In our previous therapy session, I wasn't genuinely accepting your decision for separation even as I claimed to respect it. That wasn't honest, and I apologize.
I am working to change these patterns and am committed to becoming a better person, partner, and father through consistent actions rather than just words. I respect your need for space and safety, and will honor your boundaries.
I've written some additional thoughts about my accountability and the work I'm doing if you're interested in reading them. No pressure either way.

I'm sharing this today because I believe accountability is important, but I want to be clear that I'm here primarily to listen. I know we have limited time in therapy, so I want to save most of it to really understand your perspective, if you're willing to share. I've done too much talking and not enough listening in our relationship, and I'd like to change that pattern starting now.
3/24/25
I know this is a lengthy letter, but I wanted to be complete in expressing my thoughts and realizations. Thank you for opening the envelope.
Meghan,
I want to begin by acknowledging that when I presented my previous accountability statement, I was not truly ready to honor your decision for separation. Even as I spoke about respecting your choices, I was still internally resisting and trying to change your mind rather than genuinely accepting where you are. This contradiction between my words and my actual mindset was dishonest, and I apologize for not being authentic at that moment. I understand now that true accountability means accepting your decisions, even when they're painful for me.
Through reflection and guidance, I've come to recognize that what's happening between us goes beyond just managing anger. I've become aware of power dynamics in how I communicate that I hadn't previously acknowledged (while we have spoken of this, I thought of it academically and not emotionally).
When I think about these dynamics more deeply, I realize there are several patterns that have hurt our relationship:
I've developed a pattern of speaking with certainty and authority that leaves little room for alternative perspectives. I often interrupt you mid-thought or talk over you during discussions, effectively controlling whose voice gets heard. This has likely made you feel that your thoughts and contributions aren't valued, even when I didn't consciously intend to dismiss them.
I now recognize how my physical presence, volume, and tone of voice have created an imbalance in our interactions. During disagreements, my body language and vocal intensity have sometimes created an intimidating dynamic, even when I wasn't aware of it. This pattern culminated in the moment I pushed you, which crossed a physical boundary that should never have been crossed.
I've consistently positioned practical considerations and logic as more important than emotional experiences. When you've shared feelings or concerns, I've often responded by dismissing them as less important than "facts" or by immediately jumping to problem-solving rather than understanding. This has created a dynamic where your emotional experience is devalued, while my analytical approach is treated as the standard.
When you've raised concerns about our relationship or my behavior, my default response has been defensiveness rather than genuine listening. I've focused on protecting my perspective rather than understanding yours, often deflecting criticism or finding ways to justify my actions instead of acknowledging how they affected you. This created a situation where you couldn't safely express concerns without facing resistance.
Looking back, I see how I contributed to what Sue Johnson calls a 'negative cycle,' where my anger and certainty pushed you away, while you withdrew to protect yourself. It's not about who's wrong or right in each argument—it's about how we both got stuck and lost our safe connection.
These patterns have made you feel diminished, unheard, and unsafe in our relationship, culminating in the incident where I pushed you. I now understand that while the pushing incident itself was a singular event, it wasn't disconnected from larger patterns where I've used various forms of dominance in our interactions. I understand if you feel skepticism or anger; I welcome hearing it, even if it's hard for me.
I want you to know I'm taking concrete steps toward change. I've begun working with Hunter Milligan, the coach your father recommended, who specializes in these specific issues. I'm grateful for this connection as it's already helping me recognize patterns I wasn't previously aware of. Hunter's approach focuses on identifying and releasing emotional patterns rather than just trying to intellectually "outthink" them, which I now see I've been attempting to do without success.
I'm developing a clearer understanding of the difference between feeling internal frustration versus how my behavior appears angry to others. I now see there's been a significant gap between how I experience my emotions internally and the impact my communication actually has on you. As Hunter would describe it, I've been operating from my analytical mind while ignoring the emotional signals in my body that could have helped me recognize when I was creating tension or fear.
I realize this must be draining to read, and I don't want to burden you with my process. I share it only so you know what I'm doing to make lasting changes.
I'm learning to identify my personal triggers and thought patterns that precede emotional reactions, recognizing that my thoughts about a situation—not just the situation itself—influence how I respond. When I think I'm "just being logical" or "just explaining," I'm often actually engaging in thought patterns that escalate tension rather than resolve it.
I want to share something difficult but important: I recognize that I've been experiencing a form of grief during this process. When I realized you were considering divorce, it triggered a profound sense of loss that I wasn't equipped to handle. This doesn't excuse my behavior in any way, but understanding that I was moving through stages of grief helps me see why I struggled to truly accept your decision. I've shared my internal process not to shift focus from your experience, but to be transparent about the work I'm doing. When I feel grief or fear of loss in the future, I commit to processing these feelings with my coah or support network rather than allowing them to manifest as pressure on you. Your experience and safety remain the most important considerations.
Part of my work with Hunter involves learning to recognize when I'm judging rather than understanding, when I'm trying to control rather than connect. I'm learning to identify where in my body I feel tension or resistance, and to release those feelings rather than letting them drive my behavior. This process is helping me see how much energy I've been putting into avoiding difficult emotions rather than processing them. I've discovered I have my own 'raw spots'—especially around feeling powerless or afraid of losing you. When those raw spots get triggered, I tend to respond with forceful logic or even worse explosive language. Now I see that only deepens your pain.

I recognize that sharing these realizations doesn't undo the harm I've caused or automatically rebuild trust. True accountability means consistent change over time through actions, not just words. I am committed to this process and to becoming a better person, partner, and father. I want you to know that I'm striving to become a safer place for you—someone you can turn to and trust when you're upset or hurting.
I want to be absolutely clear: I will never cross a physical boundary with you again. The moment I pushed you represents a line that should never have been crossed, and I've established firm personal boundaries to ensure nothing like that ever happens again. What feels different now is that I'm not just committing to controlling my reactions, but to fundamentally understanding and changing the underlying patterns that led to them. I realize my internal growth doesn't erase the hurt I caused; you've been forced to feel unsafe in what should be your safest relationship.
If I ever feel myself becoming emotionally flooded, I'll immediately take a time-out by saying 'I need a break to collect myself,' step outside for at least 10 minutes, and use that time to ground myself with the techniques I'm learning with Hunter. This hard but necessary change is but one modification I am committed to make.
I'm mindful that this is a process that will take time - I won't transform overnight or even in a few weeks. I'm at the beginning of this path, not the end. I know that insights alone don't create lasting change. What matters is the consistent work I do each day to practice new patterns of communication and relationship. I'm committed to this ongoing work, not just during this crisis but as a fundamental change in how I show up in relationships with you and the kids. I want to be a 'safe haven' for you, not a source of fear or pain. That means being available when you need comfort and truly showing I'm here, not just in words but in steady, reliable actions.
I respect your need for space and safety, and I will honor whatever boundaries you set as we move forward - even if my Airbnb only has a 1080p TV.
Love,
Omar
P.S. - I've been asking myself the question you may be wondering: Why did it have to get to this point? Why couldn't I have recognized these patterns and made these changes before we reached this breaking point?
The honest answer is that I didn't fully understand the seriousness or nature of our problems until now. I was aware of tension between us, but I was seeing them as isolated disagreements rather than recognizing the harmful patterns I was creating. I was interpreting our issues through my analytical lens rather than truly understanding the emotional impact; I was focused on being "right" rather than understanding your experience; and perhaps most significantly, I didn't want to face the uncomfortable truth about how my behavior was affecting you.
It shouldn't have taken this crisis for me to recognize these patterns. The fact that it did is something I take full responsibility for. I wish I had listened more deeply and been more willing to examine my own behavior when you tried to tell me about these issues. I understand that recognizing these patterns only after reaching this breaking point may reasonably cause you to question whether this change is real. I can only demonstrate through consistent actions over time that this understanding isn't temporary.
