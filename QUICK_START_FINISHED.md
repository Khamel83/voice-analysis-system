# 🚀 AI Voice Match - Quick Start Guide

**Your personalized AI voice system is ready!** Turn any AI into your voice twin in 3 simple steps.

## 🎯 What You Can Do Now

✅ **Analyze your writing** → Extract your unique voice patterns
✅ **Generate personalized prompts** → Make AI sound like you
✅ **Use with any AI** → Claude, GPT, others
✅ **Privacy-first** → Your original content is never stored

## 🛠️ 3-Step Quick Start

### Step 1: Prepare Your Data
Gather your writing samples in one folder:
- Emails (.txt, .eml)
- Documents (.txt, .md)
- Code files (.py, .js, etc.)
- Chat logs, notes, anything!

```bash
# Create a folder with your writing
mkdir my_voice_data
cp ~/Documents/emails/*.txt my_voice_data/
cp ~/projects/*.md my_voice_data/
```

### Step 2: Generate Your Voice
Run the voice analysis:

```bash
# Basic usage (recommended)
python3 src/main.py create-my-voice my_voice_data/

# Custom output file
python3 src/main.py create-my-voice my_voice_data/ -o my_personal_voice.txt

# Skip code analysis (text only)
python3 src/main.py create-my-voice my_voice_data/ --no-code
```

### Step 3: Use Your New Voice!
Copy your generated prompt and use it with any AI:

```bash
# View your generated voice prompt
cat my_personal_voice.txt
```

**Example output:**
```
# Personalized AI Assistant for Your Name
