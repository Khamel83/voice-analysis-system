# A/B TEST: YOUR AUTHENTIC WRITING vs AI WITH YOUR STYLE PROMPT

## INSTRUCTIONS:
Each pair has one line from your actual letter + one AI-generated line using your style prompt. Which sounds more like you?

---

### PAIR 1: About taking responsibility

**1A**: I want to take full responsibility for my actions and the patterns that led to them. I recognize now that last Tuesday wasn't an isolated incident but the culmination of problems I've created in our relationship.

**1B**: I need to own up to what I did and the patterns that got us here. Looking back, I see that what happened last Tuesday wasn't just a one-time thing - it's been building up from problems I've been creating between us for a while.

---

### PAIR 2: About communication patterns

**2A**: I've developed a pattern of speaking with certainty and authority that leaves little room for alternative perspectives. I often interrupt you mid-thought or talk over you during discussions, effectively controlling whose voice gets heard.

**2B**: I've realized I have this habit of talking like I'm so sure about everything, which doesn't really leave space for your perspective. I find myself interrupting you or talking over you when we're discussing things, basically controlling who gets to speak.

---

### PAIR 3: About emotional vs practical

**3A**: I've consistently positioned practical considerations and logic as more important than emotional experiences. When you've shared feelings or concerns, I've often responded by dismissing them as less important than "facts" or by immediately jumping to problem-solving rather than understanding.

**3B**: I keep treating logic and practical stuff like they're more important than feelings. When you tell me what's bothering you or share concerns, I tend to dismiss them or jump right into fixing the problem instead of actually trying to understand where you're coming from.

---

### PAIR 4: About defensiveness

**4A**: When you've raised concerns about our relationship or my behavior, my default response has been defensiveness rather than genuine listening. I've focused on protecting my perspective rather than understanding yours.

**4B**: When you bring up issues with our relationship or things I'm doing, my first reaction is to get defensive instead of really listening. I'm so focused on protecting my own viewpoint that I don't actually try to understand your side of things.

---

### PAIR 5: About making changes

**5A**: I'm learning to identify my personal triggers and thought patterns that precede emotional reactions, recognizing that my thoughts about a situation—not just the situation itself—influence how I respond.

**5B**: I'm starting to notice what triggers me and the thought patterns that happen before I get emotional. I'm realizing it's not just what happens, but how I think about it that really affects how I react to things.

---

### PAIR 6: About the process

**6A**: I'm mindful that this is a process that will take time - I won't transform overnight or even in a few weeks. I'm at the beginning of this path, not the end.

**6B**: Look, I know this isn't going to happen overnight - I'm not going to change completely in a few weeks. I'm really just starting this journey, not finishing it.
