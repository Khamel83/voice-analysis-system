### PAIR 4: Professional email

**4A**: Dear Mrs. Kim, My name is Omar Zoheri, and I was referred to you by Alison Baulos. She informed me that you were looking for more research assistants at the hospital and told me that to email you. I am a first year student concentrating in Pre-Med/Biology. I am very familiar with research work and have done much research in the past. I am available from 1130-130 on Monday and Wednesday, from 1130-300 on Thursday and 1130-5 on Friday. If you are still looking for assistants we may be able to get together and discuss the possibilities.

**4B**: Dear Mrs. Kim, I'm writing to introduce myself - my name is Omar Zoheri and Alison Baulos suggested I contact you about the research assistant position at the hospital. I'm a first-year Pre-Med/Biology student and I've got quite a bit of research experience already. My availability is Monday/Wednesday 11:30-1:30, Thursday 11:30-3:00, and Friday 11:30-5:00. If you're still looking for help, I'd love to meet and talk about the possibility of working together.

### PAIR 5: Grade concern email

**5A**: Dear Mr. Jarrell, My name is Omar Zoheri and am currently enrolled in the Chem 110's sequence, and have a question as to my grade of last quarter. Although I received a grade atleast one SD above the mean on both midterms and felt I did fairly well on the final and did well in Lab, I still received a B- for the quarter, and feel that that grade is not up to my calculations of how well I performed in the class. My lab TA, Tom Rammer, told me to contact you as to discuss this matter. If you could please respond to me with either a clarification of my grade or when we could get together and discuss it, It would be greatly appreciated.

**5B**: Dear Mr. Jarrell, I'm a student in your Chem 110 sequence and I'm hoping you could help me understand my grade from last quarter. I scored at least one standard deviation above the mean on both midterms, felt confident about my final exam performance, and received good marks in lab - yet I ended up with a B- for the quarter. This doesn't seem to align with how I thought I performed in the class. My lab TA, Tom Rammer, suggested I reach out to you to discuss this. I'd appreciate it if you could either clarify my grade or let me know when we might meet to discuss it further. Thank you for your time and consideration.
